# Customizing the 'Help' and login page messages

In large organizations, it is useful to have information about who maintains
the company GitLab server. You can customize and display this information on
the GitLab login page and on the GitLab server's `/help` page.

1. Navigate to the **Admin** area, then click on **Preferences** and expand
   **Help page**.
1. Under **Help page text**, fill in the required information about the
   person(s) administering GitLab. This text can also contain any other
   information that you wish to display to users.

1. Save your changes.

The information you entered will be shown on the GitLab login page and on the
GitLab `/help` page (e.g., <https://gitlab.com/help>).

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
