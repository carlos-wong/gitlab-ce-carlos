# Customizing the new project page

You can add a markdown-formatted message to your GitLab new project page.

By default, the new project page shows a sidebar with general information:

![default_new_project_page](new_project_page/default_new_project_page.png)

To customize the information in the sidebar:

1. Navigate to the **Admin** area and go to the **Appearance** page, then
   locate the **New project pages** section.
1. Fill in your new project project guidelines:

   ![appearance_settings](new_project_page/appearance_settings.png)

1. Save the page.

Your new project page will show the customized guidelines in the sidebar, below
the general information:

![custom_new_project_page](new_project_page/custom_new_project_page.png)

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
