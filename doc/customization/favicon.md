# Changing the favicon

> [Introduced][ce-14497] in GitLab 11.0.

[ce-14497]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/14497

You can customize the favicon (the icon displayed in your web browser's
address bar and web page tabs) for your GitLab server.

1. Navigate to the **Admin** area and go to the **Appearance** page, then
   locate the **Favicon** section.
1. Upload an image file of your favicon.

   ![appearance](favicon/appearance.png)

1. Save your changes.

Your new favicon will display in the browser. The main favicon and the CI
status icons will show the custom icon:

![custom_favicon](favicon/custom_favicon.png)

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
