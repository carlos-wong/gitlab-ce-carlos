# GitLab basics guides

This section provides resources to help you start with GitLab by focusing on basic functionality.

This documentation is split into the following groups:

- [GitLab-specific functionality](#gitlab-basics), for basic GitLab features.
- [General Git functionality](#git-basics), for working with Git in conjunction with GitLab.

## GitLab basics

The following are guides to basic GitLab functionality:

- [Create and add your SSH public key](create-your-ssh-keys.md), for enabling Git over SSH.
- [Create a project](create-project.md), to start using GitLab.
- [Create a group](../user/group/index.md#create-a-new-group), to combine and administer projects together.
- [Create a branch](create-branch.md), to make changes to files stored in a project's repository.
- [Fork a project](fork-project.md), to duplicate projects so they can be worked on in parallel.
- [Add a file](add-file.md), to add new files to a project's repository.
- [Add an image](add-image.md), to add new images to a project's repository.
- [Create an issue](../user/project/issues/create_new_issue.md), to start collaborating within a project.
- [Create a merge request](add-merge-request.md), to request changes made in a branch be merged into a project's repository.
- See how these features come together in the [GitLab Flow introduction video](https://youtu.be/InKNIvky2KE) and [GitLab Flow page](../workflow/gitlab_flow.md).

## Git basics

If you're familiar with Git on the command line, you can interact with your GitLab projects just as you would with any other Git repository.

These resources will help get further acclimated to working on the command line.

- [Start using Git on the command line](start-using-git.md), for some simple Git commands.
- [Command line basics](command-line-commands.md), to create and edit files using the command line.

More Git resources are available at GitLab's [Git documentation](../topics/git/index.md).
