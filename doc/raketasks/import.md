# Import bare repositories into your GitLab instance

## Notes

- The owner of the project will be the first admin
- The groups will be created as needed, including subgroups
- The owner of the group will be the first admin
- Existing projects will be skipped
- Projects in hashed storage may be skipped (see [Importing bare repositories from hashed storage](#importing-bare-repositories-from-hashed-storage))
- The existing Git repos will be moved from disk (removed from the original path)

## How to use

### Create a new folder to import your Git repositories from

The new folder needs to have Git user ownership and read/write/execute access for Git user and its group:

```
sudo -u git mkdir -p /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>/new_group
```

### Copy your bare repositories inside this newly created folder

- Any `.git` repositories found on any of the subfolders will be imported as projects
- Groups will be created as needed, these could be nested folders. Example:

If we copy the repos to `/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>`, and repo A needs to be under the groups G1 and G2, it will
have to be created under those folders: `/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>/G1/G2/A.git`.

```
sudo cp -r /old/git/foo.git /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>/new_group/

# Do this once when you are done copying git repositories
sudo chown -R git:git /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>
```

`foo.git` needs to be owned by the `git` user and `git` users group.

If you are using an installation from source, replace `/var/opt/gitlab/` with `/home/git`.

### Run the command below depending on your type of installation

#### Omnibus Installation

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:import:repos['/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>']
```

#### Installation from source

Before running this command you need to change the directory to where your GitLab installation is located:

```shell
cd /home/git/gitlab
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:import:repos['/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-<date>'] RAILS_ENV=production
```

#### Example output

```
Processing /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-1/a/b/c/blah.git
 * Using namespace: a/b/c
 * Created blah (a/b/c/blah)
 * Skipping repo  /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-1/a/b/c/blah.wiki.git
Processing /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-1/abcd.git
 * Created abcd (abcd.git)
Processing /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-1/group/xyz.git
 * Using namespace: group (2)
 * Created xyz (group/xyz.git)
 * Skipping repo /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repository-import-1/@shared/a/b/abcd.git

## Importing bare repositories from hashed storage

### Background

Projects in legacy storage have a directory structure that mirrors their full
project path in GitLab, including their namespace structure. This information is
leveraged by the bare repository importer to import projects into their proper
locations. Each project and its parent namespaces are meaningfully named.

However, the directory structure of projects in hashed storage do not contain
this information. This is beneficial for a variety of reasons, especially
improved performance and data integrity. See
[Repository Storage Types](../administration/repository_storage_types.md) for
more details.

### Which repositories are importable?

#### GitLab 10.3 or earlier

Importing bare repositories from hashed storage is unsupported.

#### GitLab 10.4 and later

To support importing bare repositories from hashed storage, GitLab 10.4 and
later stores the full project path with each repository, in a special section of
the Git repository's config file. This section is formatted as follows:

```
[gitlab]
  fullpath = gitlab-org/gitlab
```

However, existing repositories were not migrated to include this path.

Bare repositories are importable if the following events occurred to the
repository in GitLab 10.4 and later:

- Created
- Migrated to hashed storage
- Renamed
- Transferred to another namespace
- Ancestor renamed
- Ancestor transferred to another namespace

Bare repositories are **not** importable by GitLab 10.4 and later when all the following are true about the repository:

- It was created in GitLab 10.3 or earlier.
- It was not renamed, transferred, or migrated to hashed storage in GitLab 10.4 and later.
- Its ancestor namespaces were not renamed or transferred in GitLab 10.4 and later.

There is an [open issue to add a migration to make all bare repositories
importable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/41776).

Until then, you may wish to manually migrate repositories yourself. You can use
[Rails console](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/#starting-a-rails-console-session)
to do so. In a Rails console session, run the following to migrate a project:

```
project = Project.find_by_full_path('gitlab-org/gitlab')
project.write_repository_config
```

In a Rails console session, run the following to migrate all of a namespace's
projects (this may take a while if there are 1000s of projects in a namespace):

```
namespace = Namespace.find_by_full_path('gitlab-org')
namespace.send(:write_projects_repository_config)
```
