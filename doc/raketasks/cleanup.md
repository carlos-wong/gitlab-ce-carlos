# Cleanup

## Remove garbage from filesystem

Clean up local project upload files if they don't exist in GitLab database. The
task attempts to fix the file if it can find its project, otherwise it moves the
file to a lost and found directory.

```
# omnibus-gitlab
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:project_uploads

# installation from source
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:project_uploads RAILS_ENV=production
```

Example output:

```

## Remove orphan artifact files

When you notice there are more job artifacts files on disk than there
should be, you can run:

```shell
gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_job_artifact_files
```

This command:

- Scans through the entire artifacts folder.
- Checks which files still have a record in the database.
- If no database record is found, the file is deleted from disk.

By default, this task does not delete anything but shows what it can
delete. Run the command with `DRY_RUN=false` if you actually want to
delete the files:

```shell
gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_job_artifact_files DRY_RUN=false
```

You can also limit the number of files to delete with `LIMIT`:

```shell
gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:orphan_job_artifact_files LIMIT=100`
```

This will only delete up to 100 files from disk. You can use this to
delete a small set for testing purposes.

If you provide `DEBUG=1`, you'll see the full path of every file that
is detected as being an orphan.

If `ionice` is installed, the tasks uses it to ensure the command is
not causing too much load on the disk. You can configure the niceness
level with `NICENESS`. Below are the valid levels, but consult
`man 1 ionice` to be sure.

- `0` or `None`
- `1` or `Realtime`
- `2` or `Best-effort` (default)
- `3` or `Idle`

## Remove expired ActiveSession lookup keys

```
# omnibus-gitlab
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:cleanup:sessions:active_sessions_lookup_keys

# installation from source
bundle exec rake gitlab:cleanup:sessions:active_sessions_lookup_keys RAILS_ENV=production
```
