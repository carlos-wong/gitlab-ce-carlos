# Rake tasks **(FREE SELF)**

GitLab provides [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) tasks to assist you with
common administration and operational processes.

You can perform GitLab Rake tasks by using:

- `gitlab-rake <raketask>` for [Omnibus GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/index.html)
  installations.
- `bundle exec rake <raketask>` for [source](../install/installation.md)
  installations.
