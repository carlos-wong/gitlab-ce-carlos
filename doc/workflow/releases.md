# Releases

NOTE: In GitLab 11.7, we introduced the full fledged [Releases](../user/project/releases/index.md)
feature. You can still create release notes on this page, but the new method is preferred.

You can add release notes to any Git tag using the notes feature. Release notes
behave like any other markdown form in GitLab so you can write text and
drag-n-drop files to it. Release notes are stored in GitLab's database.

There are several ways to add release notes:

- In the interface, when you create a new Git tag
- In the interface, by adding a note to an existing Git tag
- Using the GitLab API

## New tag page with release notes text area
