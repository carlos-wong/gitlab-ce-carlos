# Merge Trains API **(PREMIUM)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/36146) in GitLab 12.9.
> - Using this API you can consume GitLab's [Merge Train](../ci/merge_request_pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results/merge_trains/index.md) entries.

Every API call to merge trains must be authenticated with Developer or higher [permissions](../user/permissions.md).

If a user is not a member of a project and the project is private, a `GET` request on that project will result to a `404` status code.

If Merge Trains is not available for the project, a `403` status code will return.

## Merge Trains API pagination

By default, `GET` requests return 20 results at a time because the API results
are paginated.

Read more on [pagination](README.md#pagination).
