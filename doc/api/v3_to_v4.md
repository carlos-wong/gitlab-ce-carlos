# API V3 to API V4

Since GitLab 9.0, API V4 is the preferred version to be used.

API V3 was unsupported from GitLab 9.5, released on August
22, 2017. API v3 was removed in [GitLab 11.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/36819).
The V3 API documentation is still
[available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/blob/8-16-stable/doc/api/README.md).

Below are the changes made between V3 and V4.
