# Integrations API **(FREE)**

This API enables you to work with external services that integrate with GitLab.

NOTE:
In GitLab 14.4, the `services` endpoint was [renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334500) to `integrations`.
Calls to the Integrations API can be made to both `/projects/:id/services` and `/projects/:id/integrations`.
The examples in this document refer to the endpoint at `/projects/:id/integrations`.

This API requires an access token with the Maintainer or Owner role.
