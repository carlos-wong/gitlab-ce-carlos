## List all members of a group or project including inherited members

Gets a list of group or project members viewable by the authenticated user, including inherited members through ancestor groups.
When a user is a member of the project/group and of one or more ancestor groups the user is returned only once with the project access_level (if exists)
or the access_level for the user in the first group which he belongs to in the project groups ancestors chain.
**Note:** We plan to [change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/62284) this behavior to return highest access_level instead.
