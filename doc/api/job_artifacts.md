# Job Artifacts API **(FREE)**

## Get job artifacts

> The use of `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in the artifacts download API was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2346) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 9.5.

Get the job's artifacts zipped archive of a project.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/jobs/:job_id/artifacts
```

| Attribute   | Type           | Required | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | integer/string | yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](index.md#namespaced-path-encoding) owned by the authenticated user. |
| `job_id`    | integer        | yes      | ID of a job.                                                                                                 |
| `job_token` **(PREMIUM)** | string | no | To be used with [triggers](../ci/jobs/ci_job_token.md#download-an-artifact-from-a-different-pipeline) for multi-project pipelines. It should be invoked only inside `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Its value is always `$CI_JOB_TOKEN`. |

Example request using the `PRIVATE-TOKEN` header:

```shell
curl --output artifacts.zip --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/42/artifacts"
```

To use this in a [`script` definition](../ci/yaml/index.md#script) inside
`.gitlab-ci.yml` **(PREMIUM)**, you can use either:

- The `JOB-TOKEN` header with the GitLab-provided `CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable.
  For example, the following job downloads the artifacts of the job with ID
  `42`. The command is wrapped in single quotes because it contains a
  colon (`:`):

  ```yaml
  artifact_download:
    stage: test
    script:
      - 'curl --location --output artifacts.zip --header "JOB-TOKEN: $CI_JOB_TOKEN" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/42/artifacts"'
  ```

- Or the `job_token` attribute with the GitLab-provided `CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable.
  For example, the following job downloads the artifacts of the job with ID `42`:

  ```yaml
  artifact_download:
    stage: test
    script:
      - 'curl --location --output artifacts.zip "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/42/artifacts?job_token=$CI_JOB_TOKEN"'
  ```

Possible response status codes:

| Status    | Description                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 200       | Serves the artifacts file.      |
| 404       | Build not found or no artifacts.|

## Download the artifacts archive

> The use of `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in the artifacts download API was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2346) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 9.5.

Download the artifacts zipped archive from the latest successful pipeline for
the given reference name and job, provided the job finished successfully. This
is the same as [getting the job's artifacts](#get-job-artifacts), but by
defining the job's name instead of its ID.

NOTE:
If a pipeline is [parent of other child pipelines](../ci/pipelines/parent_child_pipelines.md), artifacts
are searched in hierarchical order from parent to child. For example, if both parent and
child pipelines have a job with the same name, the artifact from the parent pipeline is returned.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/jobs/artifacts/:ref_name/download?job=name
```

Parameters

| Attribute   | Type           | Required | Description                                                                                                  |

To use this in a [`script` definition](../ci/yaml/index.md#script) inside
`.gitlab-ci.yml` **(PREMIUM)**, you can use either:

- The `JOB-TOKEN` header with the GitLab-provided `CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable.
  For example, the following job downloads the artifacts of the `test` job
  of the `main` branch. The command is wrapped in single quotes
  because it contains a colon (`:`):

  ```yaml
  artifact_download:
    stage: test
    script:
      - 'curl --location --output artifacts.zip --header "JOB-TOKEN: $CI_JOB_TOKEN" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/jobs/artifacts/main/download?job=test"'
  ```

- Or the `job_token` attribute with the GitLab-provided `CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable.
  For example, the following job downloads the artifacts of the `test` job
  of the `main` branch:

  ```yaml
  artifact_download:
    stage: test
    script:
      - 'curl --location --output artifacts.zip "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/jobs/artifacts/main/download?job=test&job_token=$CI_JOB_TOKEN"'
