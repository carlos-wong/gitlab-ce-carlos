# Project snippets

### Snippet visibility level

Snippets in GitLab can be either private, internal or public.
You can set it with the `visibility` field in the snippet.

Constants for snippet visibility levels are:

| visibility | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `private`  | The snippet is visible only the snippet creator |
| `internal` | The snippet is visible for any logged in user |
| `public`   | The snippet can be accessed without any authentication |
