# Tracing (DEPRECATED) **(FREE)**

> - [Moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/42645) from GitLab Ultimate to GitLab Free in 13.5.
> - [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346540) in GitLab 14.7.

WARNING:
This feature is in its end-of-life process. It is [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346540)
in GitLab 14.7, and is planned for removal in GitLab 15.0.

Tracing provides insight into the performance and health of a deployed application, tracking each
function or microservice that handles a given request. Tracing makes it easy to understand the
end-to-end flow of a request, regardless of whether you are using a monolithic or distributed
system.

## Install Jaeger

[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open source, end-to-end distributed tracing system
used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. To learn more about
installing Jaeger, read the official
[Getting Started documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/getting-started/).

- An [all-in-one Docker image](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/getting-started/#all-in-one).
- Deployment options for:
  - [Kubernetes](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-kubernetes).
  - [OpenShift](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-openshift).

## Link to Jaeger

GitLab provides an easy way to open the Jaeger UI from within your project:

1. [Set up Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) and configure your application using one of the
   [client libraries](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/client-libraries/).
1. Navigate to your project's **Settings > Monitor** and provide the Jaeger URL.
1. Click **Save changes** for the changes to take effect.
1. You can now visit **Monitor > Tracing** in your project's sidebar and GitLab redirects you to
   the configured Jaeger URL.
