# Slash commands in Mattermost and Slack **(FREE)**

> [Moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/24780) from GitLab Ultimate to GitLab Free in 11.9.

If you want to control and view GitLab content while you're
working in Slack and Mattermost, you can use slash commands.
Type the command as a message in your chat client to activate it.
For Slack, this requires an [integration configuration](../user/project/integrations/slack_slash_commands.md).

Slash commands are scoped to a project
and require the trigger command specified during configuration.

We suggest you use the project name as the trigger command for simplicity and clarity.

Assuming `project-name` is the trigger command, the slash commands are:

| Command | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| `/project-name help` | Shows all available slash commands. |
| `/project-name issue new <title> <shift+return> <description>` | Creates a new issue with title `<title>` and description `<description>`. |
| `/project-name issue show <id>` | Shows the issue with ID `<id>`. |
| `/project-name issue close <id>` | Closes the issue with ID `<id>`. |
| `/project-name issue search <query>` | Shows up to 5 issues matching `<query>`. |
| `/project-name issue move <id> to <project>` | Moves the issue with ID `<id>` to `<project>`. |
| `/project-name issue comment <id> <shift+return> <comment>` | Adds a new comment with comment body `<comment>` to the issue with ID `<id>`. |
| `/project-name deploy <from> to <to>` | [Deploys](#deploy-command) from the `<from>` environment to the `<to>` environment. |
| `/project-name run <job name> <arguments>` | Executes the [ChatOps](../ci/chatops/index.md) job `<job name>` on the default branch. |

If you are using the [GitLab Slack application](../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md) for
your GitLab.com projects, [add the `gitlab` keyword at the beginning of the command](../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md#usage).

## Issue commands

You can create a new issue, display issue details, and search up to 5 issues.

## Deploy command

To deploy to an environment, GitLab tries to find a deployment
manual action in the pipeline.

If there's only one action for a given environment, it is triggered.
If more than one action is defined, GitLab finds an action
name that equals the environment name to deploy to.

The command returns an error if no matching action is found.
