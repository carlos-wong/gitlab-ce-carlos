# Jira integration issue management **(FREE)**

Integrating issue management with Jira requires you to [configure Jira](index.md#jira-integration)
and [enable the Jira integration](configure.md) in GitLab.
After you configure and enable the integration, you can reference and close Jira
issues by mentioning the Jira ID in GitLab commits and merge requests.

The Jira integration requires to you format any Jira issue IDs in uppercase.

## Reference Jira issues

With this integration, you can cross-reference Jira issues while you work in
GitLab issues and merge requests. Mention a Jira issue in a GitLab issue,
merge request, or comment, and GitLab adds a formatted comment to the Jira issue.
The comment links back to your work in GitLab.

For example, this commit references the Jira issue `GIT-1`:

```shell
git commit -m "GIT-1 this is a test commit"
```

GitLab adds a reference to the **Issue Links** section of Jira issue `GIT-1`:

![Example of mentioning or closing the Jira issue](img/jira_issue_reference.png)

GitLab also adds a comment to the issue, and uses this format:

```plaintext
USER mentioned this issue in RESOURCE_NAME of [PROJECT_NAME|COMMENTLINK]:
ENTITY_TITLE
```

- `USER`: The name of the user who mentioned the issue, linked to their GitLab user profile.
- `COMMENTLINK`: A link to where the Jira issue was mentioned.
- `RESOURCE_NAME`: The type of resource, such as a commit or merge request, which referenced the issue.
- `PROJECT_NAME`: The GitLab project name.
- `ENTITY_TITLE`: The title of the merge request, or the first line of the commit.

You can [disable comments](#disable-comments-on-jira-issues) on issues.

### Require associated Jira issue for merge requests to be merged **(ULTIMATE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280766) in GitLab 13.12, disabled behind `jira_issue_association_on_merge_request` [feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md).
> - [Enabled by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61722) in GitLab 14.1.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335280) in GitLab 14.2.

You can prevent merge requests from being merged if they do not refer to a Jira issue.
To enforce this:

1. Navigate to your project's **Settings > General** page.
1. Expand the **Merge requests** section.
1. Under **Merge checks**, select the **Require an associated issue from Jira** checkbox.
1. Select **Save** for the changes to take effect.

After you enable this feature, a merge request that doesn't reference an associated
Jira issue can't be merged. The merge request displays the message
**To merge, a Jira issue key must be mentioned in the title or description.**

## Close Jira issues in GitLab

If you have configured GitLab transition IDs, you can close a Jira issue directly
from GitLab. Use a trigger word followed by a Jira issue ID in a commit or merge request.
When you push a commit containing a trigger word and Jira issue ID, GitLab:

1. Comments in the mentioned Jira issue.
1. Closes the Jira issue. If the Jira issue has a resolution, it isn't transitioned.

For example, use any of these trigger words to close the Jira issue `PROJECT-1`:

- `Resolves PROJECT-1`
- `Closes PROJECT-1`
- `Fixes PROJECT-1`

The commit or merge request must target your project's [default branch](../../user/project/repository/branches/default.md).
You can change your project's default branch under [project settings](img/jira_project_settings.png).

### Use case for closing issues

Consider this example:

1. A user creates Jira issue `PROJECT-7` to request a new feature.
1. You create a merge request in GitLab to build the requested feature.
1. In the merge request, you add the issue closing trigger `Closes PROJECT-7`.
1. When the merge request is merged:
   - GitLab closes the Jira issue for you:
     ![The GitLab integration closes Jira issue](img/jira_service_close_issue.png)
   - GitLab adds a formatted comment to Jira, linking back to the commit that
     resolved the issue. You can [disable comments](#disable-comments-on-jira-issues).

## View Jira issues **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3622) in GitLab 13.2.

You can browse, search, and view issues from a selected Jira project directly in GitLab,
if your GitLab administrator [has configured it](configure.md).

To do this, in GitLab, go to your project and select **Issues > Jira issues**. The issue list
sorts by **Created date** by default, with the newest issues listed at the top:

![Jira issues integration enabled](img/open_jira_issues_list_v14_6.png)

- To display the most recently updated issues first, select **Updated date**.
- You can [search and filter](#search-and-filter-the-issues-list) the issues list.
- In GitLab [versions 13.10 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299832),
  you can select an issue from the list to view it in GitLab:
  ![Jira issue detail view](img/jira_issue_detail_view_v13.10.png)

Issues are grouped into tabs based on their
[Jira status](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/defining-status-field-values-749382903.html):

- **Open** tab: All issues with a Jira status in any category other than Done.
- **Closed** tab: All issues with a Jira status categorized as Done.
- **All** tab: All issues of any status.

### Search and filter the issues list **(PREMIUM)**

To refine the list of issues, use the search bar to search for any text
contained in an issue summary (title) or description. Use any combination
of these filters:

- To filter issues by `labels`, specify one or more labels as part of the `labels[]`
  parameter in the URL. When using multiple labels, only issues that contain all specified
  labels are listed: `/-/integrations/jira/issues?labels[]=backend&labels[]=feature&labels[]=QA`
- To filter issues by `status`, specify the `status` parameter in the URL:
  `/-/integrations/jira/issues?status=In Progress`
- To filter issues by `reporter`, specify a reporter's Jira display name for the
  `author_username` parameter in the URL: `/-/integrations/jira/issues?author_username=John Smith`
- To filter issues by `assignee`, specify their Jira display name for the
  `assignee_username` parameter in the URL: `/-/integrations/jira/issues?assignee_username=John Smith`

Enhancements to use these filters through the user interface
[are planned](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3622).

## Automatic issue transitions

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55773) in GitLab 13.11.

When you configure automatic issue transitions, you can transition a referenced
Jira issue to the next available status with a category of **Done**. To configure
this setting:

1. Refer to the [Configure GitLab](configure.md) instructions.
1. Select the **Enable Jira transitions** checkbox.
1. Select the **Move to Done** option.

## Custom issue transitions

For advanced workflows, you can specify custom Jira transition IDs:

1. Use the method based on your Jira subscription status:
   - *(For users of Jira Cloud)* Obtain your transition IDs by editing a workflow
     in the **Text** view. The transition IDs display in the **Transitions** column.
   - *(For users of Jira Server)* Obtain your transition IDs in one of these ways:
     - By using the API, with a request like `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/ISSUE-123/transitions`,
       using an issue that is in the appropriate "open" state.
     - By mousing over the link for the transition you want and looking for the
       **action** parameter in the URL.
   The transition ID may vary between workflows (for example, a bug instead of a
   story), even if the status you're changing to is the same.
1. Refer to the [Configure GitLab](configure.md) instructions.
1. Select the **Enable Jira transitions** setting.
1. Select the **Custom transitions** option.
1. Enter your transition IDs in the text field. If you insert multiple transition IDs
   (separated by `,` or `;`), the issue is moved to each state, one after another, in the
   order you specify. If a transition fails, the sequence is aborted.

## Disable comments on Jira issues

GitLab can cross-link source commits or merge requests with Jira issues without
adding a comment to the Jira issue:

1. Refer to the [Configure GitLab](configure.md) instructions.
1. Clear the **Enable comments** checkbox.
