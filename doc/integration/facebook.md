1. On your GitLab server, open the configuration file.

   For Omnibus package:

   ```shell
   sudo editor /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```shell
   cd /home/git/gitlab

   sudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml
   ```

1. See [Initial OmniAuth Configuration](omniauth.md#initial-omniauth-configuration) for initial settings.

1. Add the provider configuration:

   For Omnibus package:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
     {
       "name" => "facebook",
       "app_id" => "YOUR_APP_ID",
       "app_secret" => "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
     }
   ]
   ```

   For installations from source:

   ```
   - { name: 'facebook', app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
     app_secret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' }
   ```

1. Change 'YOUR_APP_ID' to the API key from Facebook page in step 10.

1. Change 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' to the API secret from the Facebook page in step 10.

1. Save the configuration file.

1. [Reconfigure][] or [restart GitLab][] for the changes to take effect if you
   installed GitLab via Omnibus or from source respectively.

On the sign in page there should now be a Facebook icon below the regular sign in form. Click the icon to begin the authentication process. Facebook will ask the user to sign in and authorize the GitLab application. If everything goes well the user will be returned to GitLab and will be signed in.
