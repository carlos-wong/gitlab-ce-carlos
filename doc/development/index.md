# Contributor and Development Docs

Learn the processes and technical information needed for contributing to GitLab.

This content is intended for members of the GitLab Team as well as community
contributors. Content specific to the GitLab Team should instead be included in
the [Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

For information on using GitLab to work on your own software projects, see the
[GitLab user documentation](../user/index.md).

For information on working with the GitLab APIs, see the [API documentation](../api/index.md).

For information about how to install, configure, update, and upgrade your own
GitLab instance, see the [administration documentation](../administration/index.md).

## Get started

- Set up the GitLab development environment with the
  [GitLab Development Kit (GDK)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/README.md)
- [GitLab contributing guide](contributing/index.md)
  - [Issues workflow](contributing/issue_workflow.md) for more information about:
    - Issue tracker guidelines.
    - Triaging.
    - Labels.
    - Feature proposals.
    - Issue weight.
    - Regression issues.
    - Technical or UX debt.
  - [Merge requests workflow](contributing/merge_request_workflow.md) for more
    information about:
    - Merge request guidelines.

### Development guidelines review

When you submit a change to the GitLab development guidelines, who
you ask for reviews depends on the level of change.

#### Wording, style, or link changes

Not all changes require extensive review. For example, MRs that don't change the
content's meaning or function can be reviewed, approved, and merged by any
maintainer or Technical Writer. These can include:

- Typo fixes.
- Clarifying links, such as to external programming language documentation.
- Changes to comply with the [Documentation Style Guide](documentation/index.md)
  that don't change the intent of the documentation page.

#### Specific changes

If the MR proposes changes that are limited to a particular stage, group, or team,
request a review and approval from an experienced GitLab Team Member in that
group. For example, if you're documenting a new internal API used exclusively by
a given group, request an engineering review from one of the group's members.

After the engineering review is complete, assign the MR to the
[Technical Writer associated with the stage and group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#assignments)
in the modified documentation page's metadata.
If the page is not assigned to a specific group, follow the
[Technical Writing review process for development guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#assignments-to-development-guidelines).

#### Broader changes

Some changes affect more than one group. For example:

- Changes to [code review guidelines](code_review.md).
- Changes to [commit message guidelines](contributing/merge_request_workflow.md#commit-messages-guidelines).
- Changes to guidelines in [feature flags in development of GitLab](feature_flags/).
- Changes to [feature flags documentation guidelines](documentation/feature_flags.md).

In these cases, use the following workflow:

1. Request a peer review from a member of your team.
1. Request a review and approval of an Engineering Manager (EM)
   or Staff Engineer who's responsible for the area in question:

   - [Frontend](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/frontend/)
   - [Backend](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/)
   - [Database](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/database/)
   - [User Experience (UX)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/)
   - [Security](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/)
   - [Quality](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/)
     - [Engineering Productivity](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/)
   - [Infrastructure](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/)
   - [Technical Writing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/)

   You can skip this step for MRs authored by EMs or Staff Engineers responsible
   for their area.

   If there are several affected groups, you may need approvals at the
   EM/Staff Engineer level from each affected area.

1. After completing the reviews, consult with the EM/Staff Engineer
   author / approver of the MR.

   If this is a significant change across multiple areas, request final review
   and approval from the VP of Development, the DRI for Development Guidelines,
   @clefelhocz1.

1. After all approvals are complete, assign the MR to the
   [Technical Writer associated with the stage and group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#assignments)
   in the modified documentation page's metadata.
   If the page is not assigned to a specific group, follow the
   [Technical Writing review process for development guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#assignments-to-development-guidelines).
   The Technical Writer may ask for additional approvals as previously suggested before merging the MR.
