# Merge Request Checklist

When creating a merge request that performs database related changes (schema
changes, adjusting queries to optimize performance, etc) you should use the
merge request template called "Database changes". This template contains a
checklist of steps to follow to make sure the changes are up to snuff.

To use the checklist, create a new merge request and click on the "Choose a
template" dropdown, then click "Database changes".

An example of this checklist can be found at
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/12463>.

The source code of the checklist can be found in at
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Database%20changes.md>
