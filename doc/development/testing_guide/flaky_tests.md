# Flaky tests

## What's a flaky test?

It's a test that sometimes fails, but if you retry it enough times, it passes,
eventually.

## Quarantined tests

When a test frequently fails in `master`,
[a ~"master:broken" issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#broken-master)
should be created.
If the test cannot be fixed in a timely fashion, there is an impact on the
productivity of all the developers, so it should be placed in quarantine by
assigning the `:quarantine` metadata.

This means it will be skipped unless run with `--tag quarantine`:

```shell
bin/rspec --tag quarantine
```

**Before putting a test in quarantine, you should make sure that a
~"master:broken" issue exists for it so it won't stay in quarantine forever.**

Once a test is in quarantine, there are 3 choices:

- Should the test be fixed (i.e. get rid of its flakiness)?
- Should the test be moved to a lower level of testing?
- Should the test be removed entirely (e.g. because there's already a
  lower-level test, or it's duplicating another same-level test, or it's testing
  too much etc.)?

### Quarantine tests on the CI

Quarantined tests are run on the CI in dedicated jobs that are allowed to fail:

- `rspec-pg-quarantine` (CE & EE)
- `rspec-pg-quarantine-ee` (EE only)

## Automatic retries and flaky tests detection

On our CI, we use [rspec-retry] to automatically retry a failing example a few
times (see [`spec/spec_helper.rb`] for the precise retries count).

We also use a home-made `RspecFlaky::Listener` listener which records flaky
examples in a JSON report file on `master` (`retrieve-tests-metadata` and
`update-tests-metadata` jobs).

This was originally implemented in: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/13021>.

If you want to enable retries locally, you can use the `RETRIES` env variable.
For instance `RETRIES=1 bin/rspec ...` would retry the failing examples once.
