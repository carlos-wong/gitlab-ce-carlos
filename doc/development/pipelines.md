# Pipelines for the GitLab project

Pipelines for <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab> and <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss> (as well as the
`dev` instance's mirrors) are configured in the usual
[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
which itself includes files under
[`.gitlab/ci/`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/.gitlab/ci)
for easier maintenance.

We're striving to [dogfood](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#dogfooding)
GitLab [CI/CD features and best-practices](../ci/yaml/README.md)
as much as possible.

## Stages

The current stages are:

- `sync`: This stage is used to synchronize changes from <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab> to
  <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss>.
- `prepare`: This stage includes jobs that prepare artifacts that are needed by
  jobs in subsequent stages.
- `test`: This stage includes most of the tests, DB/migration jobs, and static analysis jobs.
- `post-test`: This stage includes jobs that build reports or gather data from
  the `test` stage's jobs (e.g. coverage, Knapsack metadata etc.).
- `review-prepare`: This stage includes a job that build the CNG images that are
  later used by the (Helm) Review App deployment (see
  [Review Apps](testing_guide/review_apps.md) for details).
- `review`: This stage includes jobs that deploy the GitLab and Docs Review Apps.
- `qa`: This stage includes jobs that perform QA tasks against the Review App
  that is deployed in the previous stage.
- `post-qa`: This stage includes jobs that build reports or gather data from
  the `qa` stage's jobs (e.g. Review App performance report).
- `notification`: This stage includes jobs that sends notifications about pipeline status.
- `pages`: This stage includes a job that deploys the various reports as
  GitLab Pages (e.g. <https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab/coverage-ruby/>,
  <https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab/coverage-javascript/>,
  <https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab/webpack-report/>).

## Default image

The default image is currently
`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images:ruby-2.6.5-golang-1.12-git-2.24-lfs-2.9-chrome-73.0-node-12.x-yarn-1.21-postgresql-9.6-graphicsmagick-1.3.34`.

It includes Ruby 2.6.5, Go 1.12, Git 2.24, Git LFS 2.9, Chrome 73, Node 12, Yarn 1.21,
PostgreSQL 9.6, and Graphics Magick 1.3.34.

The images used in our pipelines are configured in the
[`gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images)
project, which is push-mirrored to <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-build-images>
for redundancy.

The current version of the build images can be found in the
["Used by GitLab section"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml).

## Default variables

In addition to the [predefined variables](../ci/variables/predefined_variables.md),
each pipeline includes default variables defined in
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml>.

## Common job definitions

Most of the jobs [extend from a few CI definitions](../ci/yaml/README.md#extends)
defined in [`.gitlab/ci/global.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/global.gitlab-ci.yml)
that are scoped to a single [configuration parameter](../ci/yaml/README.md#configuration-parameters).

| Job definitions  | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `.default-tags` | Ensures a job has the `gitlab-org` tag to ensure it's using our dedicated runners. |
| `.default-retry` | Allows a job to [retry](../ci/yaml/README.md#retry) upon `unknown_failure`, `api_failure`, `runner_system_failure`, `job_execution_timeout`, or `stuck_or_timeout_failure`. |
| `.default-before_script` | Allows a job to use a default `before_script` definition suitable for Ruby/Rails tasks that may need a database running (e.g. tests). |
| `.default-cache` | Allows a job to use a default `cache` definition suitable for Ruby/Rails and frontend tasks. |
| `.use-pg9` | Allows a job to use the `postgres:9.6.17` and `redis:alpine` services. |
| `.use-pg10` | Allows a job to use the `postgres:10.12` and `redis:alpine` services. |
| `.use-pg11` | Allows a job to use the `postgres:11.6` and `redis:alpine` services. |
| `.use-pg9-ee` | Same as `.use-pg9` but also use the `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.4.2` services. |
| `.use-pg10-ee` | Same as `.use-pg10` but also use the `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.4.2` services. |
| `.use-pg11-ee` | Same as `.use-pg11` but also use the `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.4.2` services. |
| `.as-if-foss` | Simulate the FOSS project by setting the `FOSS_ONLY='1'` environment variable. |

## `workflow:rules`

We're using the [`workflow:rules` keyword](../ci/yaml/README.md#workflowrules) to
define default rules to determine whether or not a pipeline is created.

These rules are defined in <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml>
and are as follows:

1. If `$FORCE_GITLAB_CI` is set, create a pipeline.
1. For merge requests, create a pipeline.
1. For `master` branch, create a pipeline (this includes on schedules, pushes, merges, etc.).
1. For tags, create a pipeline.
1. If `$GITLAB_INTERNAL` isn't set, don't create a pipeline.
1. For stable, auto-deploy, and security branches, create a pipeline.
1. For any other cases (e.g. when pushing a branch with no MR for it), no pipeline is created.

## `rules`, `if:` conditions and `changes:` patterns

We're using the [`rules` keyword](../ci/yaml/README.md#rules) extensively.

All `rules` definitions are defined in
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml>,
then included in individual jobs via [`extends`](../ci/yaml/README.md#extends).

The `rules` definitions are composed of `if:` conditions and `changes:` patterns,
which are also defined in
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml>
and included in `rules` definitions via [YAML anchors](../ci/yaml/README.md#anchors)

### `if:` conditions

| `if:` conditions | Description | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|-------|
| `if-not-canonical-namespace`                                 | Matches if the project isn't in the canonical (`gitlab-org/`) or security (`gitlab-org/security`) namespace. | Use to create a job for forks (by using `when: on_success\|manual`), or **not** create a job for forks (by using `when: never`). |
| `if-not-ee`                                                  | Matches if the project isn't EE (i.e. project name isn't `gitlab` or `gitlab-ee`). | Use to create a job only in the FOSS project (by using `when: on_success|manual`), or **not** create a job if the project is EE (by using `when: never`). |

| `if-default-refs`                                            | Matches if the pipeline is for `master`, `/^[\d-]+-stable(-ee)?$/` (stable branches), `/^\d+-\d+-auto-deploy-\d+$/` (auto-deploy branches), `/^security\//` (security branches), merge requests, and tags. | Note that jobs won't be created for branches with this default configuration. |
| `if-master-refs`                                             | Matches if the current branch is `master`. | |
| `if-master-or-tag`                                           | Matches if the pipeline is for the `master` branch or for a tag. | |

| `if-dot-com-gitlab-org-schedule`                             | Limits jobs creation to scheduled pipelines for the `gitlab-org` group on GitLab.com. | |
| `if-dot-com-gitlab-org-master`                               | Limits jobs creation to the `master` branch for the `gitlab-org` group on GitLab.com. | |
| `if-dot-com-gitlab-org-merge-request`                        | Limits jobs creation to merge requests for the `gitlab-org` group on GitLab.com. | |
| `if-dot-com-gitlab-org-and-security-tag`                     | Limits job creation to tags for the `gitlab-org` and `gitlab-org/security` groups on GitLab.com. | |
| `if-dot-com-gitlab-org-and-security-merge-request`           | Limit jobs creation to merge requests for the `gitlab-org` and `gitlab-org/security` groups on GitLab.com. | |
| `if-dot-com-ee-schedule`                                     | Limits jobs to scheduled pipelines for the `gitlab-org/gitlab` project on GitLab.com. | |
| `if-cache-credentials-schedule`                              | Limits jobs to scheduled pipelines with the `$CI_REPO_CACHE_CREDENTIALS` variable set. | |
