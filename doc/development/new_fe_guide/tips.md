# Tips

## Clearing production compiled assets

To clear production compiled assets created with `yarn webpack-prod` you can run:

```
yarn clean
```

## Creating feature flags in development

The process for creating a feature flag is the same as [enabling a feature flag in development](../feature_flags/development.md#enabling-a-feature-flag-in-development).

Your feature flag can now be:

- [Made available to the frontend](../feature_flags/development.md#frontend) via the `gon`
- Queried in [tests](../feature_flags/development.md#specs)
- Queried in HAML templates and ruby files via the `Feature.enabled?(:my_shiny_new_feature_flag)` method
