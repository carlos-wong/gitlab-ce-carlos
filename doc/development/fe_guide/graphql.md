# GraphQL

We use [Apollo] and [Vue Apollo][vue-apollo] for working with GraphQL
on the frontend.

In order to use GraphQL, you need to enable the `graphql` feature flag,
read more about [Feature Flags][feature-flags].

## Apollo Client

To save duplicated clients getting created in different apps, we have a
[default client][default-client] that should be used. This setups the
Apollo client with the correct URL and also sets the CSRF headers.

## GraphQL Queries

To save query compilation at runtime, webpack can directly import `.graphql`
files. This allows webpack to preprocess the query at compile time instead
of the client doing compilation of queries.

To distinguish queries from mutations and fragments, the following naming convention is recommended:

- `allUsers.query.graphql` for queries;
- `addUser.mutation.graphql` for mutations;
- `basicUser.fragment.graphql` for fragments.

## Usage in Vue

To use Vue Apollo, import the [Vue Apollo][vue-apollo] plugin as well
as the default client. This should be created at the same point
the Vue application is mounted.

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueApollo from 'vue-apollo';
import createDefaultClient from '~/lib/graphql';
Vue.use(VueApollo);

const apolloProvider = new VueApollo({
  defaultClient: createDefaultClient(),
});

new Vue({
  ...,
  apolloProvider,
  ...
});
```

Read more about [Vue Apollo][vue-apollo] in the [Vue Apollo documentation][vue-apollo-docs].

### Local state with Apollo

It is possible to manage an application state with Apollo by passing
in a resolvers object when creating the default client. The default state can be set by writing
to the cache after setting up the default client.


```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueApollo from 'vue-apollo';
import createDefaultClient from '~/lib/graphql';
Vue.use(VueApollo);

const defaultClient = createDefaultClient({
  Query: {
    ...
  },
  Mutations: {
    ...
  },
});

defaultClient.cache.writeData({
  data: {
    isLoading: true,
  },
});

const apolloProvider = new VueApollo({
  defaultClient,
});
```

Read more about local state management with Apollo in the [Vue Apollo documentation](https://vue-apollo.netlify.com/guide/local-state.html#local-state).

### Testing

With [Vue test utils][vue-test-utils] it is easy to quickly test components that
fetch GraphQL queries. The simplest way is to use `shallowMount` and then set
the data on the component

```javascript
it('tests apollo component', () => {
  const vm = shallowMount(App);

  vm.setData({
    ...mock data
  });
});
```

Another possible way is testing queries with mocked GraphQL schema. Read more about this way in [Vue Apollo testing documentation](https://vue-apollo.netlify.com/guide/testing.html#tests-with-mocked-graqhql-schema)

## Usage outside of Vue

It is also possible to use GraphQL outside of Vue by directly importing
and using the default client with queries.

```javascript
import defaultClient from '~/lib/graphql';
import query from './query.graphql';

defaultClient.query(query)
  .then(result => console.log(result));
```
