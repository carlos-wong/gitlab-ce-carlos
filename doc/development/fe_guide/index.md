# Frontend Development Guidelines

This document describes various guidelines to ensure consistency and quality
across GitLab's frontend team.

## Overview

GitLab is built on top of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) using [Haml][haml] and also a JavaScript based Frontend with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
Be wary of [the limitations that come with using Hamlit][hamlit-limits]. We also use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) and plain JavaScript with
modern ECMAScript standards supported through [Babel][babel] and ES module support through [webpack][webpack].

Working with our frontend assets requires Node (v8.10.0 or greater) and Yarn
(v1.10.0 or greater). You can find information on how to install these on our
[installation guide][install].

### Browser Support

For our currently-supported browsers, see our [requirements][requirements].

Use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to test with our supported browsers. Login to BrowserStack with the credentials saved in GitLab's [shared 1Password account](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/#1password-for-teams).

- [Vue](style/vue.md). Guidelines and conventions for Vue code may be found here.

## [Tooling](tooling.md)

Our code is automatically formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to follow our guidelines. Read our [Tooling guide](tooling.md) for more detail.

## [Performance](performance.md)
