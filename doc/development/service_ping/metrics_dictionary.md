# Metrics Dictionary Guide

[Service Ping](index.md) metrics are defined in individual YAML files definitions from which the
[Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/) is built. Currently, the metrics dictionary is built automatically once a day. When a change to a metric is made in a YAML file, you can see the change in the dictionary within 24 hours.
This guide describes the dictionary and how it's implemented.

## Metrics Definition and validation

We are using [JSON Schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/metrics/schema.json) to validate the metrics definition.

This process is meant to ensure consistent and valid metrics defined for Service Ping. All metrics *must*:

- Comply with the defined [JSON schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/metrics/schema.json).
- Have a unique `key_path` .
- Have an owner.

All metrics are stored in YAML files:

- [`config/metrics`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/metrics)

WARNING:
Only metrics with a metric definition YAML and whose status is not `removed` are added to the Service Ping JSON payload.

Each metric is defined in a separate YAML file consisting of a number of fields:

| Field               | Required | Additional information                                         |
|---------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key_path`          | yes      | JSON key path for the metric, location in Service Ping payload.  |
| `name`              | no       | Metric name suggestion. Can replace the last part of `key_path`. |
| `description`       | yes      |                                                                |
| `product_section`   | yes      | The [section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/sections.yml). |
| `product_stage`     | yes       | The [stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/stages.yml) for the metric. |
| `product_group`     | yes      | The [group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/stages.yml) that owns the metric. |
| `product_category`  | no       | The [product category](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/categories.yml) for the metric. |
| `value_type`        | yes      | `string`; one of [`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html).                                                     |
| `status`            | yes      | `string`; [status](#metric-statuses) of the metric, may be set to `active`, `removed`, `broken`. |
| `time_frame`        | yes      | `string`; may be set to a value like `7d`, `28d`, `all`, `none`. |
| `data_source`       | yes      | `string`; may be set to a value like `database`, `redis`, `redis_hll`, `prometheus`, `system`. |
| `data_category`     | yes      | `string`; [categories](#data-category) of the metric, may be set to `operational`, `optional`, `subscription`, `standard`. The default value is `optional`.|
| `instrumentation_class` | yes   | `string`; [the class that implements the metric](metrics_instrumentation.md).  |
| `distribution`      | yes      | `array`; may be set to one of `ce, ee` or `ee`. The [distribution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/tiers/#definitions) where the tracked feature is available.  |
| `performance_indicator_type`  | no      | `array`; may be set to one of [`gmau`, `smau`, `paid_gmau`, or `umau`](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/xmau-analysis/). |
| `tier`              | yes      | `array`; may contain one or a combination of `free`, `premium` or `ultimate`. The [tier]( https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/tiers/) where the tracked feature is available. This should be verbose and contain all tiers where a metric is available. |

| `milestone_removed` | no       | The milestone when the metric is removed. |
| `introduced_by_url` | no       | The URL to the merge request that introduced the metric to be available for self-managed instances. |
| `removed_by_url`    | no       | The URL to the merge request that removed the metric. |
| `repair_issue_url`  | no       | The URL of the issue that was created to repair a metric with a `broken` status. |
| `options`           | no       | `object`: options information needed to calculate the metric value. |
| `skip_validation`   | no       | This should **not** be set. [Used for imported metrics until we review, update and make them valid](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5425). |

### Metric key_path

The `key_path` of the metric is the location in the JSON Service Ping payload.

The `key_path` could be composed from multiple parts separated by `.` and it must be unique.

We recommend to add the metric in one of the top-level keys:

- `settings`: for settings related metrics.
- `counts_weekly`: for counters that have data for the most recent 7 days.
- `counts_monthly`: for counters that have data for the most recent 28 days.
- `counts`: for counters that have data for all time.

NOTE:
We can't control what the metric's `key_path` is, because some of them are generated dynamically in `usage_data.rb`.
For example, see [Redis HLL metrics](implement.md#redis-hll-counters).

### Metric name

To improve metric discoverability by a wider audience, each metric with
instrumentation added at an appointed `key_path` receives a `name` attribute
filled with the name suggestion, corresponding to the metric `data_source` and instrumentation.
Metric name suggestions can contain two types of elements:

1. **User input prompts**: enclosed by angle brackets (`< >`), these pieces should be replaced or
   removed when you create a metrics YAML file.
1. **Fixed suggestion**: plaintext parts generated according to well-defined algorithms.
   They are based on underlying instrumentation, and must not be changed.

For a metric name to be valid, it must not include any prompt, and fixed suggestions
must not be changed.

#### Generate a metric name suggestion

The metric YAML generator can suggest a metric name for you.
To generate a metric name suggestion, first instrument the metric at the provided `key_path`.
Then, generate the metric's YAML definition and
return to the instrumentation and update it.

1. Add the metric instrumentation class to `lib/gitlab/usage/metrics/instrumentations/`.
1. Add the metric logic in the instrumentation class.
1. Run the [metrics YAML generator](metrics_dictionary.md#create-a-new-metric-definition).
1. Use the metric name suggestion to select a suitable metric name.
1. Update the metric's YAML definition with the correct `key_path`.

### Metric statuses

Metric definitions can have one of the following statuses:

- `active`: Metric is used and reports data.
- `broken`: Metric reports broken data (for example, -1 fallback), or does not report data at all. A metric marked as `broken` must also have the `repair_issue_url` attribute.
- `removed`: Metric was removed, but it may appear in Service Ping payloads sent from instances running on older versions of GitLab.

### Metric value_type

Metric definitions can have one of the following values for `value_type`:

- `boolean`
- `number`
- `string`
- `object`: A metric with `value_type: object` must have `value_json_schema` with a link to the JSON schema for the object.
In general, we avoid complex objects and prefer one of the `boolean`, `number`, or `string` value types.
An example of a metric that uses `value_type: object` is `topology` (`/config/metrics/settings/20210323120839_topology.yml`),
which has a related schema in `/config/metrics/objects_schemas/topology_schema.json`.

### Metric time_frame

- `7d`: The metric data applies to the most recent 7-day interval. For example, the following metric counts the number of users that create epics over a 7-day interval: `ee/config/metrics/counts_7d/20210305145820_g_product_planning_epic_created_weekly.yml`.
- `28d`: The metric data applies to the most recent 28-day interval. For example, the following metric counts the number of unique users that create issues over a 28-day interval: `config/metrics/counts_28d/20210216181139_issues.yml`.
- `all`: The metric data applies for the whole time the metric has been active (all-time interval). For example, the following metric counts all users that create issues: `/config/metrics/counts_all/20210216181115_issues.yml`.
- `none`: The metric collects a type of data that's not tracked over time, such as settings and configuration information. Therefore, a time interval is not applicable. For example, `uuid` has no time interval applicable: `config/metrics/license/20210201124933_uuid.yml`.

### Data category

We use the following categories to classify a metric:

- `operational`: Required data for operational purposes.
- `optional`: Default value for a metric. Data that is optional to collect. This can be [enabled or disabled](../../user/admin_area/settings/usage_statistics.md#enable-or-disable-usage-statistics) in the Admin Area.
- `subscription`: Data related to licensing.
- `standard`: Standard set of identifiers that are included when collecting data.

### Metric name suggestion examples

#### Metric with `data_source: database`

For a metric instrumented with SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM clusters WHERE clusters.management_project_id IS NOT NULL
```

- **Suggested name**: `count_distinct_user_id_from_<adjective describing: '(clusters.management_project_id IS NOT NULL)'>_clusters`
- **Prompt**: `<adjective describing: '(clusters.management_project_id IS NOT NULL)'>`
  should be replaced with an adjective that best represents filter conditions, such as `project_management`
- **Final metric name**: For example, `count_distinct_user_id_from_project_management_clusters`

For metric instrumented with SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT clusters.user_id)
FROM clusters_applications_helm
INNER JOIN clusters ON clusters.id = clusters_applications_helm.cluster_id
WHERE clusters_applications_helm.status IN (3, 5)
```

- **Suggested name**: `count_distinct_user_id_from_<adjective describing: '(clusters_applications_helm.status IN (3, 5))'>_clusters_<with>_<adjective describing: '(clusters_applications_helm.status IN (3, 5))'>_clusters_applications_helm`
- **Prompt**: `<adjective describing: '(clusters_applications_helm.status IN (3, 5))'>`
  should be replaced with an adjective that best represents filter conditions
- **Final metric name**: `count_distinct_user_id_from_clusters_with_available_clusters_applications_helm`

In the previous example, the prompt is irrelevant, and user can remove it. The second
occurrence corresponds with the `available` scope defined in `Clusters::Concerns::ApplicationStatus`.
It can be used as the right adjective to replace prompt.

The `<with>` represents a suggested conjunction for the suggested name of the joined relation.
The person documenting the metric can use it by either:

- Removing the surrounding `<>`.
- Using a different conjunction, such as `having` or `including`.

#### Metric with `data_source: redis` or `redis_hll`

For metrics instrumented with a Redis-based counter, the suggested name includes
only the single prompt to be replaced by the person working with metrics YAML.

- **Prompt**: `<please fill metric name, suggested format is: {subject}_{verb}{ing|ed}_{object} eg: users_creating_epics or merge_requests_viewed_in_single_file_mode>`
- **Final metric name**: We suggest the metric name should follow the format of
  `{subject}_{verb}{ing|ed}_{object}`, such as `user_creating_epics`, `users_triggering_security_scans`,
  or `merge_requests_viewed_in_single_file_mode`

#### Metric with `data_source: prometheus` or `system`

For metrics instrumented with Prometheus or coming from the operating system,
the suggested name includes only the single prompt by person working with metrics YAML.

- **Prompt**: `<please fill metric name>`
- **Final metric name**: Due to the variety of cases that can apply to this kind of metric,
  no naming convention exists. Each person instrumenting a metric should use their
  best judgment to come up with a descriptive name.

### Example YAML metric definition

The linked [`uuid`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/config/metrics/license/uuid.yml)
YAML file includes an example metric definition, where the `uuid` metric is the GitLab
instance unique identifier.

```yaml
key_path: uuid
description: GitLab instance unique identifier
product_category: collection
product_section: growth
product_stage: growth
product_group: product_intelligence
value_type: string
status: active
milestone: 9.1
instrumentation_class: UuidMetric
introduced_by_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/1521
time_frame: none
data_source: database
distribution:
- ce
- ee
tier:
- free
- premium
- ultimate
```

### Create a new metric definition

The GitLab codebase provides a dedicated [generator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/generators/gitlab/usage_metric_definition_generator.rb) to create new metric definitions.

For uniqueness, the generated files include a timestamp prefix in ISO 8601 format.

The generator takes a list of key paths and 3 options as arguments. It creates metric YAML definitions in the corresponding location:

- `--ee`, `--no-ee` Indicates if metric is for EE.
- `--dir=DIR` Indicates the metric directory. It must be one of: `counts_7d`, `7d`, `counts_28d`, `28d`, `counts_all`, `all`, `settings`, `license`.
- `--class_name=CLASS_NAME` Indicates the instrumentation class. For example `UsersCreatingIssuesMetric`, `UuidMetric`

**Single metric example**

```shell
bundle exec rails generate gitlab:usage_metric_definition counts.issues --dir=7d --class_name=CountIssues
// Creates 1 file
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/issues.yml
```

**Multiple metrics example**

```shell
bundle exec rails generate gitlab:usage_metric_definition counts.issues counts.users --dir=7d --class_name=CountUsersCreatingIssues
// Creates 2 files
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/issues.yml
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/users.yml
```

NOTE:
To create a metric definition used in EE, add the `--ee` flag.

```shell
bundle exec rails generate gitlab:usage_metric_definition counts.issues --ee --dir=7d --class_name=CountUsersCreatingIssues
// Creates 1 file
// create  ee/config/metrics/counts_7d/issues.yml
```

### Metrics added dynamic to Service Ping payload

The [Redis HLL metrics](implement.md#known-events-are-added-automatically-in-service-data-payload) are added automatically to Service Ping payload.

A YAML metric definition is required for each metric. A dedicated generator is provided to create metric definitions for Redis HLL events.

The generator takes `category` and `events` arguments, as the root key is `redis_hll_counters`, and creates two metric definitions for each of the events (for weekly and monthly time frames):

**Single metric example**

```shell
bundle exec rails generate gitlab:usage_metric_definition:redis_hll issues count_users_closing_issues
// Creates 2 files
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/count_users_closing_issues_weekly.yml
// create  config/metrics/counts_28d/count_users_closing_issues_monthly.yml
```

**Multiple metrics example**

```shell
bundle exec rails generate gitlab:usage_metric_definition:redis_hll issues count_users_closing_issues count_users_reopening_issues
// Creates 4 files
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/count_users_closing_issues_weekly.yml
// create  config/metrics/counts_28d/count_users_closing_issues_monthly.yml
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/count_users_reopening_issues_weekly.yml
// create  config/metrics/counts_28d/count_users_reopening_issues_monthly.yml
```

To create a metric definition used in EE, add the `--ee` flag.

```shell
bundle exec rails generate gitlab:usage_metric_definition:redis_hll issues users_closing_issues --ee
// Creates 2 files
// create  config/metrics/counts_7d/i_closed_weekly.yml
// create  config/metrics/counts_28d/i_closed_monthly.yml
```

## Metrics Dictionary

[Metrics Dictionary is a separate application](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/product-intelligence/metric-dictionary).

All metrics available in Service Ping are in the [Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/).

### Copy query to clipboard

To check if a metric has data in Sisense, use the copy query to clipboard feature. This copies a query that's ready to use in Sisense. The query gets the last five service ping data for GitLab.com for a given metric. For information about how to check if a Service Ping metric has data in Sisense, see this [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4o65ivta48).
