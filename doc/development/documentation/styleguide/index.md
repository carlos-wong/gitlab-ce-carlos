# Documentation Style Guide

This document defines the standards for GitLab documentation, including grammar, formatting, word use, and more.

For style questions, mention `@tw-style` in an issue or merge request. If you have access to the GitLab Slack workspace,
use the `#docs-processes` channel.

In addition to this page, the following resources can help you craft and contribute to documentation:

- [Doc contribution guidelines](../index.md)
- [Recommended word list](word_list.md)
- [Doc style and consistency testing](../testing.md)
- [UI text guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/content/error-messages/)
- [GitLab Handbook style guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines)
- [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
- [Recent updates to this guide](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&label_name[]=tw-style&not[label_name][]=docs%3A%3Afix)

## Documentation is the single source of truth (SSOT)

The GitLab documentation is the SSOT for all
information related to GitLab implementation, usage, and troubleshooting. It evolves
continuously, in keeping with new products and features, and with improvements
for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

This policy prevents information silos, making it easier to find information
about GitLab products.

It also informs decisions about the kinds of content we include in our
documentation.

### The documentation includes all information

Include problem-solving actions that may address rare cases or be considered
risky, but provide proper context through fully detailed
warnings and caveats. This kind of content should be included as it could be
helpful to others and, when properly explained, its benefits outweigh the risks.
If you think you have found an exception to this rule, contact the
Technical Writing team.

GitLab adds all troubleshooting information to the documentation, no matter how
unlikely a user is to encounter a situation.

GitLab Support maintains their own
[troubleshooting content](../../../administration/index.md#support-team-docs)
in the GitLab documentation.

### The documentation includes all media types

Include any media types/sources if the content is relevant to readers. You can
freely include or link presentations, diagrams, and videos. No matter who
it was originally composed for, if it is helpful to any of our audiences, we can
include it.

- If you use an image that has a separate source file (for example, a vector or
  diagram format), link the image to the source file so that anyone can update or reuse it.
- Do not copy and paste content from other sources unless it is a limited
  quotation with the source cited. Typically it is better to either rephrase
  relevant information in your own words or link out to the other source.

### Topic types

In the software industry, it is a best practice to organize documentation in
different types. For example:

- Concepts
- Tasks
- Reference
- Troubleshooting

At GitLab, we have not traditionally used topic types. However, we are starting to
move in this direction, so we can address these issues:

- **Content is hard to find.** Our docs are comprehensive and include a large amount of
  useful information. Topic types create repeatable patterns that make our content easier
  to scan and parse.
- **Content is often written from the contributor's point of view.**  Our docs
  are written by contributors. Topic types (tasks specifically) help put
  information into a format that is geared toward helping others, rather than
  documenting how a feature was implemented.

GitLab uses these [topic type templates](../structure.md).

### Link instead of repeating text

Rather than repeating information from another topic, link to the single source
of truth and explain why it is important.

### Docs-first methodology

We employ a documentation-first methodology. This method ensures the documentation
remains a complete and trusted resource, and makes communicating about the use
of GitLab more efficient.

- If the answer to a question exists in documentation, share the link to the
  documentation instead of rephrasing the information.
- When you encounter new information not available in GitLab documentation (for
  example, when working on a support case or testing a feature), your first step
  should be to create a merge request (MR) to add this information to the
  documentation. You can then share the MR to communicate this information.

New information that would be useful toward the future usage or troubleshooting
of GitLab should not be written directly in a forum or other messaging system,
but added to a documentation MR and then referenced, as described above.

The more we reflexively add information to the documentation, the more
the documentation helps others efficiently accomplish tasks and solve problems.

If you have questions when considering, authoring, or editing documentation, ask
the Technical Writing team. They're available on Slack in `#docs` or in GitLab by
mentioning [the writer for](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/#assignments)
the applicable [DevOps stage or group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages).
Otherwise, forge ahead with your best effort. It does not need to be perfect;
the team is happy to review and improve upon your content. Review the
[Documentation guidelines](index.md) before you begin your first documentation MR.

Maintaining a knowledge base separate from the documentation would
be against the documentation-first methodology, because the content would overlap with
the documentation.

## Markdown

All GitLab documentation is written using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

The [documentation website](https://docs.gitlab.com) uses [GitLab Kramdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab_kramdown),
a "flavored" Kramdown engine to render pages from Markdown to HTML. The use of Kramdown's
features is limited by our linters, so, use regular Markdown and follow the rules in the
linked style guide. You can't use Kramdown-specific markup (for example, `{:.class}`).

### HTML in Markdown

Hard-coded HTML is valid, although it's discouraged from being used. HTML is permitted if:

- There's no equivalent markup in Markdown.
- Advanced tables are necessary.
- Special styling is required.
- Reviewed and approved by a technical writer.

### Markdown Rules

GitLab ensures that the Markdown used across all documentation is consistent, as
well as easy to review and maintain, by [testing documentation changes](../testing.md)
with [markdownlint](../testing.md#markdownlint). This lint test fails when any
document has an issue with Markdown formatting that may cause the page to render
incorrectly in GitLab. It also fails when a document has
non-standard Markdown (which may render correctly, but is not the current
standard for GitLab documentation).

#### Markdown rule `MD044/proper-names` (capitalization)

A rule that could cause confusion is `MD044/proper-names`, as it might not be
immediately clear what caused markdownlint to fail, or how to correct the
failure. This rule checks a list of known words, listed in the `.markdownlint.yml`
file in each project, to verify proper use of capitalization and backticks.
Words in backticks are ignored by markdownlint.

In general, product names should follow the exact capitalization of the official
names of the products, protocols, and so on.

Some examples fail if incorrect capitalization is used:

- MinIO (needs capital `IO`)
- NGINX (needs all capitals)
- runit (needs lowercase `r`)

Additionally, commands, parameters, values, filenames, and so on must be
included in backticks. For example:

- "Change the `needs` keyword in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`..."
  - `needs` is a parameter, and `.gitlab-ci.yml` is a file, so both need backticks.
    Additionally, `.gitlab-ci.yml` without backticks fails markdownlint because it
    does not have capital G or L.
- "Run `git clone` to clone a Git repository..."
  - `git clone` is a command, so it must be lowercase, while Git is the product,
    so it must have a capital G.

## Language

GitLab documentation should be clear and easy to understand.

- Avoid unnecessary words.
- Be clear, concise, and stick to the goal of the topic.
- Write in US English with US grammar. (Tested in [`British.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/British.yml).)

### Capitalization

#### Headings

Use sentence case. For example:

- `# Use variables to configure pipelines`
- `## Use the To-Do List`

#### UI text

When referring to specific user interface text, like a button label or menu
item, use the same capitalization that's displayed in the user interface.
Standards for this content are listed in the [Pajamas Design System Content section](https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation/)
and typically match what's mentioned in this Documentation Style Guide.

If you think the user interface text contains style mistakes,
create an issue or an MR to propose a change to the user interface text.

#### Feature names

- Feature names are typically lowercase.
- Some features require title case, typically nouns that name GitLab-specific capabilities or tools. Features requiring
  title case should be:
  - Added as a proper name to markdownlint [configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.markdownlint.yml),
    so that it can be consistently applied across all documentation.
  - Added to the [word list](word_list.md).

If the term is not in the word list, ask a GitLab Technical Writer for advice.

Do not match the capitalization of terms or phrases on the [Features page](https://about.gitlab.com/features/)
or [features.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/features.yml)
by default.

#### Other terms

Capitalize names of:

- GitLab [product tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/). For example,
  GitLab Free and GitLab Ultimate. (Tested in [`BadgeCapitalization.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/BadgeCapitalization.yml).)
- Third-party organizations, software, and products. For example, Prometheus,
  Kubernetes, Git, and The Linux Foundation.
- Methods or methodologies. For example, Continuous Integration,
  Continuous Deployment, Scrum, and Agile.

Follow the capitalization style listed at the authoritative source
for the entity, which may use non-standard case styles. For example: GitLab and
npm.

### Fake user information

You may need to include user information in entries such as a REST call or user profile.
Do not use real user information or email addresses in GitLab documentation. For email
addresses and names, use:

- Email addresses: Use an email address ending in `example.com`.
- Names: Use strings like `example_username`. Alternatively, use diverse or
  non-gendered names with common surnames, such as `Sidney Jones`, `Zhang Wei`,
  or `Alex Garcia`.

### Fake URLs

When including sample URLs in the documentation, use:

- `example.com` when the domain name is generic.
- `gitlab.example.com` when referring only to self-managed GitLab instances.
  Use `gitlab.com` for GitLab SaaS instances.

### Fake tokens

There may be times where a token is needed to demonstrate an API call using
cURL or a variable used in CI. It is strongly advised not to use real tokens in
documentation even if the probability of a token being exploited is low.

You can use these fake tokens as examples:

| Token type            | Token value                                                        |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personal access token | `<your_access_token>`                                             |
| Application ID        | `2fcb195768c39e9a94cec2c2e32c59c0aad7a3365c10892e8116b5d83d4096b6` |
| Application secret    | `04f294d1eaca42b8692017b426d53bbc8fe75f827734f0260710b83a556082df` |
| CI/CD variable        | `Li8j-mLUVA3eZYjPfd_H`                                             |
| Specific runner token | `yrnZW46BrtBFqM7xDzE7dddd`                                         |
| Shared runner token   | `6Vk7ZsosqQyfreAxXTZr`                                             |
| Trigger token         | `be20d8dcc028677c931e04f3871a9b`                                   |
| Webhook secret token  | `6XhDroRcYPM5by_h-HLY`                                             |
| Health check token    | `Tu7BgjR9qeZTEyRzGG2P`                                             |
| Request profile token | `7VgpS4Ax5utVD2esNstz`                                             |

### Contractions

Contractions are encouraged, and can create a friendly and informal tone,
especially in tutorials, instructional documentation, and
[user interfaces](https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation/#contractions).

Some contractions, however, should be avoided:

<!-- vale gitlab.Possessive = NO -->

| Do not use a contraction      | Example                                          | Use instead                                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| With a proper noun and a verb | The **Container Registry's** a powerful feature. | The **Container Registry** is a powerful feature.                |
| To emphasize a negative       | **Don't** install X with Y.                      | **Do not** install X with Y.                                     |
| In reference documentation    | **Don't** set a limit.                           | **Do not** set a limit.                                          |
| In error messages             | Requests to localhost **aren't** allowed.        | Requests to localhost **are not** allowed.                        |

<!-- vale gitlab.Possessive = YES -->

### Acronyms

If you use an acronym, spell it out on first use on a page. You do not need to spell it out more than once on a page.
When possible, try to avoid acronyms in headings.

### Numbers

When using numbers in text, spell out zero through nine, and use numbers for 10 and greater. For details, see the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/numbers).

## Text

- [Write in Markdown](#markdown).
- Splitting long lines (preferably up to 100 characters) can make it easier to
  provide feedback on small chunks of text.
- Insert an empty line for new paragraphs.
- Insert an empty line between different markups (for example, after every
  paragraph, header, list, and so on). Example:

  ```markdown
  ## Header

  Paragraph.

  - List item 1
  - List item 2
  ```

### Comments

To embed comments within Markdown, use standard HTML comments that are not rendered
when published. Example:

```html
<!-- This is a comment that is not rendered -->
```

### Emphasis

Use **bold** rather than italic to provide emphasis. GitLab uses a sans-serif font and italic text does not stand out as much as it would in a serif font. For details, see [Butterick's Practical Typography guide on bold or italic](https://practicaltypography.com/bold-or-italic.html).

You can use italics when you are introducing a term for the first time. Otherwise, use bold.

- Use double asterisks (`**`) to mark a word or text in bold (`**bold**`).
- Use underscore (`_`) for text in italics (`_italic_`).
- Use greater than (`>`) for blockquotes.

### Punctuation

Follow these guidelines for punctuation:

<!-- vale gitlab.Repetition = NO -->

- End full sentences with a period.
- Use one space between sentences.
- Do not use semicolons. Use two sentences instead.
- Do not use double spaces. (Tested in [`SentenceSpacing.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/SentenceSpacing.yml).)
- Do not use non-breaking spaces. Use standard spaces instead. (Tested in [`lint-doc.sh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/scripts/lint-doc.sh).)
- Do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead. You can configure your code editor to output spaces instead of tabs when pressing the tab key.
- Use serial (Oxford) commas before the final **and** or **or** in a list of three or more items. (Tested in [`OxfordComma.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/OxfordComma.yml).)
- Avoid dashes. Use separate sentences, or commas, instead.
- Do not use typographer's ("curly") quotes. Use straight quotes instead. (Tested in [`NonStandardQuotes.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/NonStandardQuotes.yml).)

<!-- vale gitlab.Repetition = YES -->

### Placeholder text

You might want to provide a command or configuration that
uses specific values.

In these cases, use [`<` and `>`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_message#Pattern)
to call out where a reader must replace text with their own value.

For example:

```shell
cp <your_source_directory> <your_destination_directory>
```

### Keyboard commands

Use the HTML `<kbd>` tag when referring to keystroke presses. For example:

```plaintext
To stop the command, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
```

When the docs are generated, the output is:

To stop the command, press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

### Text entered in the UI

If you want the user to type something in the UI, use backticks. For example:

```plaintext
In the **Commit message** box, type `This is my merge request`.
```

Backticks are more precise than quotes. For example, in this string:

- In the **Commit message** box, type "This is my merge request."

It's not clear whether the user should include the period in the string.

## Lists

- Always start list items with a capital letter, unless they're parameters or
  commands that are in backticks, or similar.
- Always leave a blank line before and after a list.
- Begin a line with spaces (not tabs) to denote a [nested sub-item](#nesting-inside-a-list-item).

### Choose between an ordered or unordered list

Use ordered lists for a sequence of steps. For example:

```markdown
Follow these steps to do something.

1. First, do the first step.
1. Then, do the next step.
1. Finally, do the last step.
```

Use an unordered lists when the steps do not need to be completed in order. For example:

```markdown
These things are imported:

- Thing 1
- Thing 2
- Thing 3
```

You can choose to introduce either list with a colon, but you do not have to.

### Markup

- Use dashes (`-`) for unordered lists instead of asterisks (`*`).
- Prefix `1.` to every item in an ordered list. When rendered, the list items
  display with sequential numbering.

### Punctuation

- Don't add commas (`,`) or semicolons (`;`) to the ends of list items.
- If a list item is a complete sentence (with a subject and a verb), add a period at the end.
- Majority rules. If the majority of items do not end in a period, do not end any of the items in a period.
- Separate list items from explanatory text with a colon (`:`). For example:

  ```markdown
  The list is as follows:

  - First item: this explains the first item.
  - Second item: this explains the second item.
  ```

### Nesting inside a list item

It's possible to nest items under a list item, so that they render with the same
indentation as the list item. This can be done with:

- [Code blocks](#code-blocks)
- [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)
- [Alert boxes](#alert-boxes)
- [Images](#images)

Items nested in lists should always align with the first character of the list
item. In unordered lists (using `-`), this means two spaces for each level of
indentation:

````markdown
- Unordered list item 1

  A line nested using 2 spaces to align with the `U` above.

- Unordered list item 2

  > A quote block that will nest
  > inside list item 2.

- Unordered list item 3

  ```plaintext
  a code block that nests inside list item 3
  ```

- Unordered list item 4

  ![an image that will nest inside list item 4](image.png)
````

For ordered lists, use three spaces for each level of indentation:

````markdown
1. Ordered list item 1

   A line nested using 3 spaces to align with the `O` above.

1. Ordered list item 2

   > A quote block that will nest
   > inside list item 2.

1. Ordered list item 3

   ```plaintext
   a code block that nests inside list item 3
   ```

1. Ordered list item 4

   ![an image that will nest inside list item 4](image.png)
````

You can nest full lists inside other lists using the same rules as above. If you
want to mix types, that's also possible, if you don't mix items at the same
level:

```markdown
1. Ordered list item one.
1. Ordered list item two.
   - Nested unordered list item one.
   - Nested unordered list item two.
1. Ordered list item three.

- Unordered list item one.
- Unordered list item two.
  1. Nested ordered list item one.
  1. Nested ordered list item two.
- Unordered list item three.
```

## Tables

Tables should be used to describe complex information in a straightforward
manner. Note that in many cases, an unordered list is sufficient to describe a
list of items with a single, simple description per item. But, if you have data
that's best described by a matrix, tables are the best choice.

### Creation guidelines

To keep tables accessible and scannable, tables should not have any
empty cells. If there is no otherwise meaningful value for a cell, consider entering
**N/A** for 'not applicable' or **None**.

To help tables be easier to maintain, consider adding additional spaces to the
column widths to make them consistent. For example:

```markdown
| App name | Description          | Requirements   |
|:---------|:---------------------|:---------------|
| App 1    | Description text 1.  | Requirements 1 |
| App 2    | Description text 2.  | None           |
```

Consider installing a plugin or extension in your editor for formatting tables:

- [Markdown Table Prettifier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=darkriszty.markdown-table-prettify) for Visual Studio Code
- [Markdown Table Formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Table%20Formatter) for Sublime Text
- [Markdown Table Formatter](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-table-formatter) for Atom

### Feature tables

When creating tables of lists of features (such the features
available to each role on the [Permissions](../../../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions)
page), use these phrases:

| Option | Markdown                 | Displayed result       |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| No     | `**{dotted-circle}** No` | **{dotted-circle}** No |
| Yes    | `**{check-circle}** Yes` | **{check-circle}** Yes |

### Footnotes

To indicate a footnote, use the HTML tag `<sup>` with a number.
Put the tag at the end of the sentence or term.

For the footnotes below the table, use a bold number followed by a sentence.

For example:

```markdown
| App name | Description                      |
|:---------|:---------------------------------|
| App A    | Description text. <sup>1</sup>   |
| App B    | Description text. <sup>2</sup>   |

1. This is the footnote.
1. This is the other footnote.
```

This text renders this output:

| App name | Description                      |
|:---------|:---------------------------------|
| App A    | Description text. <sup>1</sup>   |
| App B    | Description text. <sup>2</sup>   |

1. This is the footnote.
1. This is the other footnote.

## Quotes

Valid for Markdown content only, not for front matter entries:

- Standard quotes: double quotes (`"`). Example: "This is wrapped in double
  quotes".
- Quote inside a quote: double quotes (`"`) wrap single quotes (`'`). Example:
  "This sentence 'quotes' something in a quote".

For other punctuation rules, refer to the
[Pajamas Design System Punctuation section](https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation/).
This is overridden by the [documentation-specific punctuation rules](#punctuation).

## Headings

In the Markdown document:

- Add one H1 (`#`) at the start of the page. The `h1` becomes the document `<title>`.
- After the H1, follow the order `h2` > `h3` > `h4` > `h5` > `h6`.
- Do not skip a level. For example: `h2` > `h4`.
- Leave one blank line before and after the heading.

For the heading text, **do**:

- Be clear and direct. Make every word count.
- Use active verbs for tasks. For example, `Configure GDK` instead of `Configuring GDK`.
- Talk about what the product does, realistically but from a positive perspective. Instead of
  `Limitations`, move the content near other similar information. If you must, you can
  use the title `Known issues`.
- Use articles and prepositions.
- Add the [product badge](#product-tier-badges) that corresponds to the license tier.
- Follow [capitalization](#capitalization) guidelines.

For the heading text, **do not**:

- Use generic words like `Overview` or `Use cases`. Instead, incorporate
  the information under a concept heading.
- Use `How it works`. Incorporate this information under a concept, or use a
  noun followed by `workflow`. For example, `Merge request workflow`.
- Use `Important Notes`. Incorporate this information closer to where it belongs.
- Use numbers to indicate steps. If the numbers change, the anchor links changes,
  which eventually leads to dead links. If you think you must add numbers in headings,
  at least discuss it with a writer in the merge request.
- Use words that might change in the future. Changing
  a heading changes its anchor URL, which affects other linked pages.
- Repeat text from earlier headings. For example, instead of `Troubleshooting merge requests`,
  use `Troubleshooting`.
- Use links.

### Anchor links

Headings generate anchor links when rendered. `## This is an example` generates
the anchor `#this-is-an-example`.

NOTE:
[Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/39717) in
GitLab 13.4, [product badges](#product-tier-badges) used in headings aren't
included in the generated anchor links. For example, when you link to
`## This is an example **(FREE)**`, use the anchor `#this-is-an-example`.

Keep in mind that the GitLab user interface links to many documentation pages
and anchor links to take the user to the right spot. When you change
a heading, search `doc/*`, `app/views/*`, and `ee/app/views/*` for the old
anchor. If you do not fix these links, the [`ui-docs-lint` job](../testing.md#ui-link-tests)
in your merge request fails.

Important:

- Avoid crosslinking documentation to headings unless you need to link to a
  specific section of the document. This avoids breaking anchors in the
  future in case the heading is changed.
- If possible, avoid changing headings, because they're not only linked internally.
  There are various links to GitLab documentation on the internet, such as
  tutorials, presentations, StackOverflow posts, and other sources.
- Do not link to `h1` headings.

Note that with Kramdown, it's possible to add a custom ID to an HTML element
with Markdown markup, but they don't work in `/help`. Because of this, don't use
this option.

## Links

Links are important in GitLab documentation. Use links instead of
summarizing to help preserve a [single source of truth](#documentation-is-the-single-source-of-truth-ssot)
in GitLab documentation.

- How to [include links with version text](#where-to-put-version-text).
- How to [link to specific lines of code](#link-to-specific-lines-of-code)

### Basic link criteria

- Use inline link Markdown markup `[Text](https://example.com)`.
  It's easier to read, review, and maintain. Do not use `[Text][identifier]` reference-style links.

- Use meaningful anchor text.
  For example, instead of writing something like `Read more about merge requests [here](LINK)`,
  write `Read more about [merge requests](LINK)`.

### Links to internal documentation

NOTE:
**Internal** refers to documentation in the same project. When linking to
documentation in separate projects (for example, linking to Omnibus documentation
from GitLab documentation), you must use absolute URLs.

Do not use absolute URLs like `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/index.html` to
cross-link to other documentation in the same project. Use relative links to
the file, like `../index.md`. (These are converted to HTML when the site is
rendered.)

Relative linking enables crosslinks to work:

- in Review Apps, local previews, and `/help`.
- when working on the documentation locally, so you can verify that they work as
  early as possible in the process.
- in the GitLab user interface when browsing doc files in their respective
  repositories. For example, the links displayed at
  `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/README.md`.

To link to internal documentation:

- Use relative links to Markdown files in the same repository.
- Do not use absolute URLs or URLs from `docs.gitlab.com`.
- Use `../` to navigate to higher-level directories.
- Don't prepend `./` to links to files or directories. To link to a file in the
  same directory or one of its sub-directories, use the syntax `path/to/file.md`.
- Don't link relative to root. For example, `/ee/user/gitlab_com/index.md`.

  Don't:

  - `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting.html`
  - `/ee/administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting.md`
  - `./troubleshooting.md`

  Do: `../../geo/replication/troubleshooting.md`

- Always add the filename `file.md` at the end of the link with the `.md`
  extension, not `.html`.

  Don't:

  - `../../merge_requests/`
  - `../../issues/tags.html`
  - `../../issues/tags.html#stages`

  Do:

  - `../../merge_requests/index.md`
  - `../../issues/tags.md`
  - `../../issues/tags.md#stages`
  - `issues/tags.md`

NOTE:
Using the Markdown extension is necessary for the [`/help`](../index.md#gitlab-help)
section of GitLab.

### Links to external documentation

When describing interactions with external software, it's often helpful to
include links to external documentation. When possible, make sure that you're
linking to an [**authoritative** source](#authoritative-sources). For example,
if you're describing a feature in Microsoft's Active Directory, include a link
to official Microsoft documentation.

### Authoritative sources

When citing external information, use sources that are written by the people who
created the item or product in question. These sources are the most likely to be
accurate and remain up to date.

Examples of authoritative sources include:

- Specifications, such as a [Request for Comments](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/)
  document from the Internet Engineering Task Force.
- Official documentation for a product. For example, if you're setting up an
  interface with the Google OAuth 2 authorization server, include a link to
  Google's documentation.
- Official documentation for a project. For example, if you're citing NodeJS
  functionality, refer directly to [NodeJS documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
- Books from an authoritative publisher.

Examples of sources to avoid include:

- Personal blog posts.
- Wikipedia.
- Non-trustworthy articles.
- Discussions on forums such as Stack Overflow.
- Documentation from a company that describes another company's product.

While many of these sources to avoid can help you learn skills and or features,
they can become obsolete quickly. Nobody is obliged to maintain any of these
sites. Therefore, we should avoid using them as reference literature.

NOTE:
Non-authoritative sources are acceptable only if there is no equivalent
authoritative source. Even then, focus on non-authoritative sources that are
extensively cited or peer-reviewed.

### Links requiring permissions

Don't link directly to:

- [Confidential issues](../../../user/project/issues/confidential_issues.md).
- Project features that require [special permissions](../../../user/permissions.md)
  to view.

These fail for:

- Those without sufficient permissions.
- Automated link checkers.

Instead:

- To reduce confusion, mention in the text that the information is either:
  - Contained in a confidential issue.
  - Requires special permission to a project to view.
- Provide a link in back ticks (`` ` ``) so that those with access to the issue
  can navigate to it.

Example:

```markdown
For more information, see the [confidential issue](../../../user/project/issues/confidential_issues.md) `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/<issue_number>`.
```

### Link to specific lines of code

When linking to specific lines in a file, link to a commit instead of to the
branch. Lines of code change over time. Linking to a line by using
the commit link ensures the user lands on the line you're referring to. The
**Permalink** button, displayed when viewing a file in a project,
provides a link to the most recent commit of that file.

- Do: `[link to line 3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/11f17c56d8b7f0b752562d78a4298a3a95b5ce66/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md#L3)`
- Don't: `[link to line 3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20proposal.md#L3).`

If that linked expression has changed line numbers due to additional
commits, you can still search the file for that query. In this case, update the
document to ensure it links to the most recent version of the file.

## Navigation

When documenting how to navigate through the GitLab UI:

- Always use location, then action.
  - From the **Visibility** dropdown list (location), select **Public** (action).
- Be brief and specific. For example:
  - Do: Select **Save**.
  - Do not: Select **Save** for the changes to take effect.
- If a step must include a reason, start the step with it. This helps the user scan more quickly.
  - Do: To view the changes, in the merge request, select the link.
  - Do not: Select the link in the merge request to view the changes.

### Names for menus

Use these terms when referring to the main GitLab user interface
elements:

- **Top bar**: This is the top bar that spans the width of the user interface.
  It includes the menu, the GitLab logo, search field, counters, and the user's avatar.
- **Left sidebar**: This is the navigation sidebar on the left of the user
  interface, specific to the project or group.
- **Right sidebar**: This is the navigation sidebar on the right of the user
  interface, specific to the open issue, merge request, or epic.

### Names for UI elements

UI elements, like button and checkbox names, should be **bold**.
Guidance for each individual UI element is in [the word list](word_list.md).

### How to write navigation task steps

To be consistent, use these templates when you write navigation steps in a task topic.

To open project settings:

```markdown
1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
```

To open group settings:

```markdown
1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Groups** and find your group.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
```

To open the Admin Area:

```markdown
1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
```

To select your avatar:

```markdown
1. On the top bar, in the top right corner, select your avatar.
```

To save the selection in some dropdown lists:

```markdown
1. Go to your issue.
1. On the right sidebar, in the **Iteration** section, select **Edit**.
1. From the dropdown list, select the iteration to associate this issue with.
1. Select any area outside the dropdown list.
```

### Optional steps

If a step is optional, start the step with the word `Optional` followed by a period.

For example:

```markdown
1. Optional. Enter a description for the job.
```

### Documenting multiple fields at once

If the UI text sufficiently explains the fields in a section, do not include a task step for every field.
Instead, summarize multiple fields in a single task step.

Use the phrase **Complete the fields**.

For example:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Repository**.
1. Expand **Push rules**.
1. Complete the fields.

If you are documenting multiple fields and only one field needs explanation, do it in the same step:

1. Expand **Push rules**.
1. Complete the fields. **Branch name** must be a regular expression.

To describe multiple fields, use bullets:

1. Expand **General pipelines**.
1. Complete the fields.
   - **Branch name** must be a regular expression.
   - **User** must be a user with at least the **Maintainer** role.

## Images

Images, including screenshots, can help a reader better understand a concept.
However, they should be used sparingly because:

- They tend to become out-of-date.
- They are difficult and expensive to localize.
- They cannot be read by screen readers.

When needed, use images to help the reader understand:

- Where they are in a complicated process.
- How they should interact with the application.

### Capture the image

When you take screenshots:

- **Ensure it provides value.** Don't use `lorem ipsum` text.
  Try to replicate how the feature would be used in a real-world scenario, and
  [use realistic text](#fake-user-information).
- **Capture only the relevant UI.** Don't include unnecessary white
  space or areas of the UI that don't help illustrate the point. The
  sidebars in GitLab can change, so don't include
  them in screenshots unless absolutely necessary.
- **Keep it small.** If you don't need to show the full width of the screen, don't.
  Reduce the size of your browser window as much as possible to keep elements close
  together and reduce empty space. Try to keep the screenshot dimensions as small as possible.
- **Review how the image renders on the page.** Preview the image locally or use the
review app in the merge request. Make sure the image isn't blurry or overwhelming.
- **Be consistent.** Coordinate screenshots with the other screenshots already on
  a documentation page for a consistent reading experience. Ensure your navigation theme
  is **Indigo** and the syntax highlighting theme is **Light**. These are the default preferences.

### Add callouts

If you need to emphasize an area in a screenshot, use an arrow.

- For color, use `#EE2604`. If you use the Preview application on macOS, this is the default red.
- For the line width, use 3 pt. If you use the Preview application on macOS, this is the third line in the list.
- Use the arrow style shown in the following image.
- If you have multiple arrows, make them parallel when possible.

![callout example](img/callouts.png)

### Save the image

- Resize any wide or tall screenshots if needed, but make sure the screenshot is
  still clear after being resized and compressed.
- All images **must** be [compressed](#compress-images) to 100KB or less.
  In many cases, 25-50KB or less is often possible without reducing image quality.
- Save the image with a lowercase filename that's descriptive of the feature
  or concept in the image:
  - If the image is of the GitLab interface, append the GitLab version to the filename,
    based on this format: `image_name_vX_Y.png`. For example, for a screenshot taken
    from the pipelines page of GitLab 11.1, a valid name is `pipelines_v11_1.png`.
  - If you're adding an illustration that doesn't include parts of the user interface,
    add the release number corresponding to the release the image was added to.
    For an MR added to 11.1's milestone, a valid name for an illustration is `devops_diagram_v11_1.png`.
- Place images in a separate directory named `img/` in the same directory where
  the `.md` document that you're working on is located.
- Consider using PNG images instead of JPEG.
- Compress GIFs with <https://ezgif.com/optimize> or similar tool.
- Images should be used (only when necessary) to illustrate the description
  of a process, not to replace it.
- See also how to link and embed [videos](#videos) to illustrate the documentation.

### Add the image link to content

The Markdown code for including an image in a document is:
`![Image description which will be the alt tag](img/document_image_title_vX_Y.png)`

The image description is the alt text for the rendered image on the
documentation site. For accessibility and SEO, use [descriptions](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)
that:

- Are accurate, succinct, and unique.
- Don't use **image of** or **graphic of** to describe the image.

### Compress images

You should always compress any new images you add to the documentation. One
known tool is [`pngquant`](https://pngquant.org/), which is cross-platform and
open source. Install it by visiting the official website and following the
instructions for your OS.

If you use macOS and want all screenshots to be compressed automatically, read
[One simple trick to make your screenshots 80% smaller](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/01/30/simple-trick-for-smaller-screenshots/).

GitLab has a [Ruby script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/bin/pngquant)
that you can use to simplify the manual process. In the root directory of your local
copy of `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab`, run in a terminal:

- Before compressing, if you want, check that all documentation PNG images have
  been compressed:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant lint
  ```

- Compress all documentation PNG images using `pngquant`:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant compress
  ```

- Compress specific files:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant compress doc/user/img/award_emoji_select.png doc/user/img/markdown_logo.png
  ```

- Compress all PNG files in a specific directory:

  ```shell
  bin/pngquant compress doc/user/img
  ```

### Animated images

Sometimes an image with animation (such as an animated GIF)
can help the reader understand a complicated interaction with the user interface.

However, you should use them sparingly and avoid them when you can.
Do not use them to replace written descriptions of processes or the product.

If you include an animated image, follow the same size and naming conventions we use for images. If the animated image loops, add at least a three
second pause to the end of the loop.

## Videos

Adding GitLab YouTube video tutorials to the documentation is highly
encouraged, unless the video is outdated. Videos should not replace
documentation, but complement or illustrate it. If content in a video is
fundamental to a feature and its key use cases, but isn't adequately
covered in the documentation, you should:

- Add this detail to the documentation text.
- Create an issue to review the video and update the page.

Do not upload videos to the product repositories. [Link](#link-to-video) or
[embed](#embed-videos) them instead.

### Link to video

To link out to a video, include a YouTube icon so that readers can scan the page
for videos before reading:

```markdown
<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
For an overview, see [Video Title](link-to-video).
```

You can link any up-to-date video that's useful to the GitLab user.

### Embed videos

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/merge_requests/472) in GitLab 12.1.

The [GitLab documentation site](https://docs.gitlab.com) supports embedded
videos.

You can embed videos from [the official YouTube account for GitLab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg) only.
For videos from other sources, [link](#link-to-video) them instead.

In most cases, [link to a video](#link-to-video), because
embedded videos take up a lot of space on the page and can be distracting to readers.

To embed a video:

1. Copy the code from this procedure and paste it into your Markdown file. Leave a
   blank line above and below it. Do not edit the code (don't remove or add any spaces).
1. In YouTube, visit the video URL you want to display. Copy the regular URL
   from your browser (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO-ID`) and replace
   the video title and link in the line under `<div class="video-fallback">`.
1. In YouTube, select **Share**, and then select **Embed**.
1. Copy the `<iframe>` source (`src`) **URL only**
   (`https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO-ID`),
   and paste it, replacing the content of the `src` field in the
   `iframe` tag.

```html
leave a blank line here
<div class="video-fallback">
  See the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqL6BMOySIQ">Video title</a>.
</div>
<figure class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqL6BMOySIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
leave a blank line here
```

This is how it renders on the GitLab documentation site:

<div class="video-fallback">
  See the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enMumwvLAug">What is GitLab</a>.
</div>
<figure class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqL6BMOySIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

> Notes:
>
> - The `figure` tag is required for semantic SEO and the `video_container`
class is necessary to make sure the video is responsive and displays on
different mobile devices.
> - The `<div class="video-fallback">` is a fallback necessary for
`/help`, because the GitLab Markdown processor doesn't support iframes. It's
hidden on the documentation site, but is displayed by `/help`.

## Code blocks

- Always wrap code added to a sentence in inline code blocks (`` ` ``).
  For example, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `git add .`, `CODEOWNERS`, or `only: [main]`.
  File names, commands, entries, and anything that refers to code should be
  added to code blocks. To make things easier for the user, always add a full
  code block for things that can be useful to copy and paste, as they can do it
  with the button on code blocks.
- HTTP methods (`HTTP POST`) and HTTP status codes, both full (`404 File Not Found`)
  and abbreviated (`404`), should be wrapped in inline code blocks when used in sentences.
  For example: Send a `DELETE` request to delete the runner. Send a `POST` request to create one.
- Add a blank line above and below code blocks.
- When providing a shell command and its output, prefix the shell command with `$`
  and leave a blank line between the command and the output.
- When providing a command without output, don't prefix the shell command with `$`.
- If you need to include triple backticks inside a code block, use four backticks
  for the code block fences instead of three.
- For regular fenced code blocks, always use a highlighting class corresponding to
  the language for better readability. Examples:

  ````markdown
  ```ruby
  Ruby code
  ```

  ```javascript
  JavaScript code
  ```

  ```markdown
  [Markdown code example](example.md)
  ```

  ```plaintext
  Code or text for which no specific highlighting class is available.
  ```
  ````

Syntax highlighting is required for fenced code blocks added to the GitLab
documentation. Refer to this table for the most common language classes,
or check the [complete list](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers)
of available language classes:

| Preferred language tags | Language aliases and notes                                                   |

| `json`                  |                                                                              |
| `markdown`              | Alias: `md`.                                                                 |
| `mermaid`               |                                                                              |

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/issues/384) in GitLab 12.7.

You can use icons from the [GitLab SVG library](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/)
directly in the documentation. For example, `**{tanuki}**` renders as: **{tanuki}**.

In most cases, you should avoid using the icons in text.
However, you can use an icon when hover text is the only
available way to describe a UI element. For example, **Delete** or **Edit** buttons
often have hover text only.

When you do use an icon, start with the hover text and follow it with the SVG reference in parentheses.

- Avoid: `Select **{pencil}** **Edit**.` This generates as: Select **{pencil}** **Edit**.
- Use instead: `Select **Edit** (**{pencil}**).` This generates as: Select **Edit** (**{pencil}**).

Do not use words to describe the icon:

- Avoid: `Select **Erase job log** (the trash icon).`
- Use instead: `Select **Erase job log** (**{remove}**).` This generates as: Select **Erase job log** (**{remove}**).

## Alert boxes

Use alert boxes to call attention to information. Use them sparingly, and never have an alert box immediately follow another alert box.

Alert boxes are generated when one of these words is followed by a line break:

- `FLAG:`
- `NOTE:`
- `WARNING:`
- `INFO:` (Marketing only)
- `DISCLAIMER:`

For example:

```markdown
NOTE:
This is something to note.
```

To display an alert box for multiple paragraphs, lists, or headers, use
[blockquotes](#blockquotes) instead.

Alert boxes render only on the GitLab documentation site (<https://docs.gitlab.com>).
In the GitLab product help, alert boxes appear as plain text.

### Flag

Use this alert type to describe a feature's availability. For information about how to format
`FLAG` alerts, see [Document features deployed behind feature flags](../feature_flags.md).

### Note

Use notes sparingly. Too many notes can make topics difficult to scan.

Instead of adding a note:

- Re-write the sentence as part of a paragraph.
- Put the information into its own paragraph.
- Put the content under a new subheading.

If you must use a note, use this format:

```markdown
NOTE:
This is something to note.
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

NOTE:
This is something to note.

### Warning

Use a warning to indicate deprecated features, or to provide a warning about
procedures that have the potential for data loss.

```markdown
WARNING:
This is something to be warned about.
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

WARNING:
This is something to be warned about.

### Info

The Marketing team uses the `INFO` alert to add information relating
to sales and marketing efforts.

The text in an `INFO:` alert always renders in a floating text box to the right of the text around it.
To view the rendered GitLab docs site, check the review app in the MR. You might need to move the text up or down
in the surrounding text, depending on where you'd like to floating box to appear.

For example, if your page has text like this:

```markdown
This is an introductory paragraph. GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git.
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server,
you don't need to supply your username and password each time.

INFO:
Here is some information. This information is an important addition to how you
work with GitLab and you might want to consider it.

And here is another paragraph. GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git.
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server,
you don't need to supply your username and password each time.

And here is another paragraph. GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git.
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server,
you don't need to supply your username and password each time.
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

This is an introductory paragraph. GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git.
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server,
you don't need to supply your username and password each time.

INFO:

### Disclaimer

Use to describe future functionality only.
For more information, see [Legal disclaimer for future features](#legal-disclaimer-for-future-features).

## Blockquotes

For highlighting a text inside a blockquote, use this format:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

> This is a blockquote.

If the text spans multiple lines, you can split them.

For multiple paragraphs, use the symbol `>` before every line:

```markdown
> This is the first paragraph.
>
> This is the second paragraph.
>
> - This is a list item
> - Second item in the list
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

> This is the first paragraph.
>
> This is the second paragraph.
>
> - This is a list item
> - Second item in the list

## Terms

To maintain consistency through GitLab documentation, use these styles and terms.

### Describe UI elements

Follow these styles when you're describing user interface elements in an
application:

- For elements with a visible label, use that label in bold with matching case.
  For example, `Select **Cancel**`.
- For elements with a tooltip or hover label, use that label in bold with
  matching case. For example, `Select **Add status emoji**`.

## GitLab versions

GitLab product documentation pages (not including [Contributor and Development](../../index.md)
pages in the `/development` directory) can include version information to help
users be aware of recent improvements or additions.

The GitLab Technical Writing team determines which versions of
documentation to display on this site based on the GitLab
[Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support.html#version-support).

### View older GitLab documentation versions

Older versions of GitLab may no longer have documentation available from `docs.gitlab.com`.
If documentation for your version is no longer available from `docs.gitlab.com`, you can still view a
tagged and released set of documentation for your installed version:

- In the [documentation archives](https://docs.gitlab.com/archives/).
- At the `/help` URL of your GitLab instance.
- In the documentation repository based on the respective branch (for example,
  the [13.2 branch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/13-2-stable-ee/doc)).

### Where to put version text

When a feature is added or updated, you can include its version information
either as a **Version history** item or as an inline text reference.

#### Version text in the **Version History**

If all content in a section is related, add version text after the header for
the section. The version information must:

- Be surrounded by blank lines.
- Start with `>`. If there are multiple bullets, each line must start with `> -`.
- The string must include these words in this order (capitalization doesn't matter):
  - `introduced`, `enabled`, `deprecated`, `changed`, `moved`, `recommended` (as in the
  [feature flag documentation](../feature_flags.md)), `removed`, or `renamed`
  - `in` or `to`
  - `GitLab`
- Whenever possible, include a link to the completed issue, merge request, or epic
  that introduced the feature. An issue is preferred over a merge request, and
  a merge request is preferred over an epic.
- Do not include information about the tier, unless documenting a tier change
  (for example, `Feature X [moved](issue-link) to Premium in GitLab 19.2`).
- Do not link to the pricing page.
  The tier is provided by the [product badge](#product-tier-badges) on the heading.

```markdown
## Feature name

> [Introduced](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab 11.3.

This feature does something.

## Feature name 2

> - [Introduced](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab 11.3.
> - [Enabled by default](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab 11.4.

This feature does something else.
```

If you're documenting elements of a feature, start with the feature name or a gerund:

```markdown
> - Notifications for expiring tokens [introduced](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab 11.3.
> - Creating an issue from an issue board [introduced](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab 13.1.
```

If a feature is moved to another tier:

```markdown
> - [Moved](<link-to-issue>) from GitLab Ultimate to GitLab Premium in 11.8.
> - [Moved](<link-to-issue>) from GitLab Premium to GitLab Free in 12.0.
```

#### Inline version text

If you're adding content to an existing topic, you can add version information
inline with the existing text.

In this case, add `([introduced/deprecated](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab X.X)`.

Including the issue link is encouraged, but isn't a requirement. For example:

```markdown
The voting strategy in GitLab 13.4 and later requires the primary and secondary
voters to agree.
```

#### Deprecated features

When a feature is deprecated, add `(DEPRECATED)` to the page title or to
the heading of the section documenting the feature, immediately before
the tier badge:

```markdown
<!-- Page title example: -->
# Feature A (DEPRECATED) **(ALL TIERS)**

<!-- Doc section example: -->
## Feature B (DEPRECATED) **(PREMIUM SELF)**
```

Add the deprecation to the version history note (you can include a link
to a replacement when available):

```markdown
> - [Deprecated](<link-to-issue>) in GitLab 11.3. Replaced by [meaningful text](<link-to-appropriate-documentation>).
```

You can also describe the replacement in surrounding text, if available. If the
deprecation isn't obvious in existing text, you may want to include a warning:

```markdown
WARNING:
This feature was [deprecated](link-to-issue) in GitLab 12.3 and replaced by
[Feature name](link-to-feature-documentation).
```

If you add `(DEPRECATED)` to the page's title and the document is linked from the docs
navigation, either remove the page from the nav or update the nav item to include the
same text before the feature name:

```yaml
 - doc_title: (DEPRECATED) Feature A
```

In the first major GitLab version after the feature was deprecated, be sure to
remove information about that deprecated feature.

#### End-of-life for features or products

When a feature or product enters its end-of-life, indicate its status by
creating a [warning alert](#alert-boxes) directly after its relevant header.
If possible, link to its deprecation and removal issues.

For example:

```markdown
WARNING:
This feature is in its end-of-life process. It is [deprecated](link-to-issue)
in GitLab X.X, and is planned for [removal](link-to-issue) in GitLab X.X.
```

After the feature or product is officially deprecated and removed, remove
its information from the GitLab documentation.

### Versions in the past or future

When describing functionality available in past or future versions, use:

- Earlier, and not older or before.
- Later, and not newer or after.

For example:

- Available in GitLab 13.1 and earlier.
- Available in GitLab 12.4 and later.
- In GitLab 12.2 and earlier, ...
- In GitLab 11.6 and later, ...

### Promising features in future versions

Do not promise to deliver features in a future release. For example, avoid phrases like,
"Support for this feature is planned."

We cannot guarantee future feature work, and promises
like these can raise legal issues. Instead, say that an issue exists.
For example:

- Support for improvements is tracked `[in this issue](LINK)`.
- You cannot do this thing, but `[an issue exists](LINK)` to change this behavior.

You can say that we plan to remove a feature.

#### Legal disclaimer for future features

If you **must** write about features we have not yet delivered, put this exact disclaimer near the content it applies to.

```markdown
DISCLAIMER:
This page contains information related to upcoming products, features, and functionality.
It is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only.
Please do not rely on this information for purchasing or planning purposes.
As with all projects, the items mentioned on this page are subject to change or delay.
The development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the
sole discretion of GitLab Inc.
```

It renders on the GitLab documentation site as:

DISCLAIMER:
This page contains information related to upcoming products, features, and functionality.
It is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only.
Please do not rely on this information for purchasing or planning purposes.
As with all projects, the items mentioned on this page are subject to change or delay.
The development, release, and timing of any products, features, or functionality remain at the
sole discretion of GitLab Inc.

If all of the content on the page is not available, use the disclaimer once at the top of the page.

If the content in a topic is not ready, use the disclaimer in the topic.

### Removing versions after each major release

When a major GitLab release occurs, we remove all references
to now-unsupported versions. This removal includes version-specific instructions. For example,
if GitLab version 12.1 and later are supported,
instructions for users of GitLab 11 should be removed.

[View the list of supported versions](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support.html#version-support).

To view historical information about a feature, review GitLab
[release posts](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/), or search for the issue or
merge request where the work was done.

## Products and features

Refer to the information in this section when describing products and features
in the GitLab product documentation.

### Avoid line breaks in names

If a feature or product name contains spaces, don't split the name with a line break.
When names change, it is more complicated to search or grep text that has line breaks.

### Product tier badges

Tier badges are displayed as orange text next to a heading. These badges link to the GitLab
pricing page. For example:

![Tier badge](img/tier_badge.png)

You must assign a tier badge:

- To all H1 topic headings.
- To topic headings that don't apply to the same tier as the H1.

To add a tier badge to a heading, add the relevant tier badge
after the heading text. For example:

```markdown
# Heading title **(FREE)**
```

Do not add tier badges inline with other text, except for [API attributes](../restful_api_styleguide.md).
The single source of truth for a feature should be the heading where the
functionality is described.

#### Available product tier badges

| Tier in which feature is available                                      | Tier badge            |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| GitLab Free self-managed and SaaS, and higher tiers                     | `**(FREE)**`          |
| GitLab Premium self-managed and SaaS, and their higher tiers            | `**(PREMIUM)**`       |
| GitLab Ultimate self-managed and SaaS                                   | `**(ULTIMATE)**`      |
| Only GitLab Free self-managed and higher tiers (no SaaS-based tiers)    | `**(FREE SELF)**`     |
| Only GitLab Premium self-managed and higher tiers (no SaaS-based tiers) | `**(PREMIUM SELF)**`  |
| Only GitLab Ultimate self-managed (no SaaS-based tiers)                 | `**(ULTIMATE SELF)**` |
| Only GitLab Free SaaS and higher tiers (no self-managed instances)      | `**(FREE SAAS)**`     |
| Only GitLab Premium SaaS and higher tiers (no self-managed instances)   | `**(PREMIUM SAAS)**`  |
| Only GitLab Ultimate SaaS (no self-managed instances)                   | `**(ULTIMATE SAAS)**` |

Topics that mention the `gitlab.rb` file are referring to
self-managed instances of GitLab. To prevent confusion, include the relevant `TIER SELF`
tier badge on the highest applicable heading level on
the page.

## Specific sections

Certain styles should be applied to specific sections. Styles for specific
sections are outlined in this section.

### GitLab restart

When a restart or reconfigure of GitLab is required, avoid duplication by linking
to [`doc/administration/restart_gitlab.md`](../../../administration/restart_gitlab.md)
with text like this, replacing 'reconfigure' with 'restart' as needed:

```markdown
Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab](../../../administration/restart_gitlab.md)
for the changes to take effect.
```

If the document resides outside of the `doc/` directory, use the full path
instead of the relative link:
`https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/restart_gitlab.html`.

### Installation guide

In [step 2 of the installation guide](../../../install/installation.md#2-ruby),
we install Ruby from source. To update the guide for a new Ruby version:

- Change the version throughout the code block.
- Replace the sha256sum. It's available on the
  [downloads page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) of the Ruby website.

### Configuration documentation for source and Omnibus installations

GitLab supports two installation methods: installations from source, and Omnibus
packages. Possible configuration settings include:

- Settings that touch configuration files in `config/`.
- NGINX settings.
- Other settings in `lib/support/`.

Configuration procedures can require users to edit configuration files, reconfigure
GitLab, or restart GitLab. Use these styles to document these steps, replacing
`PATH/TO` with the appropriate path:

````markdown
**For Omnibus installations**

1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`:

   ```ruby
   external_url "https://gitlab.example.com"
   ```

1. Save the file and [reconfigure](PATH/TO/administration/restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure)
   GitLab for the changes to take effect.

---

**For installations from source**

1. Edit `config/gitlab.yml`:

   ```yaml
   gitlab:
     host: "gitlab.example.com"
   ```

1. Save the file and [restart](PATH/TO/administration/restart_gitlab.md#installations-from-source)
   GitLab for the changes to take effect.
````

In this case:

- Bold the installation method's name.
- Separate the methods with three dashes (`---`) to create a horizontal line.
- Indent the code blocks to line up with the list item they belong to..
- Use the appropriate syntax highlighting for each code block.
- Use the [GitLab Restart](#gitlab-restart) section to explain any required
  restart or reconfigure of GitLab.

## Feature flags

Learn how to [document features deployed behind flags](../feature_flags.md). For
guidance on developing GitLab with feature flags, see [Feature flags in development of GitLab](../../feature_flags/index.md).
