# Agile and Git

## Agile

Lean software development methods focused on collaboration and interaction
with fast and smaller deployment cycles.

## Where Git comes in

Git is an excellent tool for an Agile team considering that it allows
decentralized and simultaneous development.

### Branching And Workflows

Branching in an Agile environment usually happens around user stories with one
or more developers working on it.

If more than one developer then another branch for each developer is also used
with their initials, and US id.

After its tested merge into master and remove the branch.

## What about GitLab

Tools like GitLab enhance collaboration by adding dialog around code mainly
through issues and merge requests.
