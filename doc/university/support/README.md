# Support Boot Camp

**Goal:** Prepare new Service Engineers at GitLab

For each stage, there are learning goals and content to support the learning of the engineer.
The goal of this boot camp is to have every Service Engineer prepared to help our customers
with whatever needs they might have and to also assist our awesome community with their
questions.

Always start with the [University Overview](../README.md) and then work
your way here for more advanced and specific training. Once you feel comfortable
with the topics of the current stage, move to the next.

## Stage 1

Follow the topics on the [University Overview](../README.md), concentrate on it
during your first Stage, but also:

- Perform the [first steps](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/onboarding/#first-steps) of
   the on-boarding process for new Service Engineers

### Goals

Aim to have a good overview of the Product and main features, Git and the Company

## Stage 2

Continue to look over remaining portions of the [University Overview](../README.md) and continue on to these topics:

### Set up your development machine

Get your development machine ready to familiarize yourself with the codebase, the components, and to be prepared to reproduce issues that our users encounter

- Install the [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit)
  - [Set up OpenLDAP as part of this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit#openldap)

### Become comfortable with the Installation processes that we support

It's important to understand how to install GitLab in the same way that our users do. Try installing different versions and upgrading and downgrading between them. Installation from source will give you a greater understanding of the components that we employ and how everything fits together.

Sometimes we need to upgrade customers from old versions of GitLab to latest, so it's good to get some experience of doing that now.

- [Installation Methods](https://about.gitlab.com/install/):
  - [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/)
  - [Docker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/tree/master/docker)
  - [Source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md)
- Get yourself a Digital Ocean droplet, where you can install and maintain your own instance of GitLab
  - Ask in #infrastructure about this
  - Populate with some test data
  - Keep this up-to-date as patch and version releases become available, just like our customers would
- Try out the following installation path
  - [Install GitLab 4.2 from source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/blob/d67117b5a185cfb15a1d7e749588ff981ffbf779/doc/install/installation.md)
    - External MySQL database
    - External NGINX

### Goals

- Aim to become a fully-fledged Service Engineer!

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
