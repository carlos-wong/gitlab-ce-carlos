# Customer relations management (CRM) **(FREE)**

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available, ask an administrator to [enable the feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `customer_relations`.
On GitLab.com, this feature is not available.

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2256) in GitLab 14.6 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `customer_relations`. Disabled by default.
> - In GitLab 14.8 and later, you can [create contacts and organizations only in root groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350634).

With customer relations management (CRM) you can create a record of contacts
(individuals) and organizations (companies) and relate them to issues.

Contacts and organizations can only be created for root groups.

You can use contacts and organizations to tie work to customers for billing and reporting purposes.
To read more about what is planned for the future, see [issue 2256](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2256).

## Autocomplete contacts **(FREE SELF)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2256) in GitLab 14.8 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `contacts_autocomplete`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available, ask an administrator to [enable the feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `contacts_autocomplete`.
On GitLab.com, this feature is not available.
This feature is not ready for production use.

When you use the `/add_contacts` or `/remove_contacts` quick actions, follow them with `[contact:` and an autocomplete list appears:

```plaintext
/add_contacts [contact:
/remove_contacts [contact:
```

## Moving objects with CRM entries

The root group is the topmost group in the group hierarchy.

When you move an issue, project, or group **within the same group hierarchy**,
issues retain their contacts.

When you move an issue or project and the **root group changes**,
issues lose their contacts.

When you move a group and its **root group changes**:

- All unique contacts and organizations are migrated to the new root group.
- Contacts that already exist (by email address) are deemed duplicates and deleted.
- Organizations that already exist (by name) are deemed duplicates and deleted.
- All issues retain their contacts or are updated to point at contacts with the same email address.

If you do not have permission to create contacts and organizations in the new
root group, the group transfer fails.
