# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/3775)
in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 10.3.

NOTE: **4 of the top 6 attacks were application based.**
Download our whitepaper,
["A Seismic Shift in Application Security"](https://about.gitlab.com/resources/whitepaper-seismic-shift-application-security/)
to learn how to protect your organization.

## Overview

If you are using [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/README.md), you can analyze your source code for known
vulnerabilities using Static Application Security Testing (SAST).

You can take advantage of SAST by either [including the CI job](#configuration) in
your existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or by implicitly using
[Auto SAST](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md#auto-sast-ultimate)
that is provided by [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md).

GitLab checks the SAST report, compares the found vulnerabilities between the
source and target branches, and shows the information right on the merge request.

![SAST Widget](img/sast.png)

The results are sorted by the priority of the vulnerability:

1. Critical
1. High
1. Medium
1. Low
1. Unknown
1. Everything else

## Use cases

- Your code has a potentially dangerous attribute in a class, or unsafe code
  that can lead to unintended code execution.
- Your application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that can
  be leveraged to unauthorized access to session data.

## Requirements

To run a SAST job, you need GitLab Runner with the
[`docker`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#use-docker-in-docker-with-privileged-mode) or
[`kubernetes`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#running-privileged-containers-for-the-runners)
executor running in privileged mode. If you're using the shared Runners on GitLab.com,
this is enabled by default.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
If you use your own Runners, make sure that the Docker version you have installed
is **not** `19.03.00`. See [troubleshooting information](#error-response-from-daemon-error-processing-tar-file-docker-tar-relocation-error) for details.

NOTE: **Note:**
The Java analyzers can also be used for variants like the
[Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html),
[Grails](https://grails.org/) and the [Maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).

## Configuration

For GitLab 11.9 and later, to enable SAST, you must
[include](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#includetemplate) the
[`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
that's provided as a part of your GitLab installation.
For GitLab versions earlier than 11.9, you can copy and use the job as defined
that template.

Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  template: SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
```

The included template will create a `sast` job in your CI/CD pipeline and scan
your project's source code for possible vulnerabilities.

The results will be saved as a
[SAST report artifact](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#artifactsreportssast-ultimate)
that you can later download and analyze. Due to implementation limitations, we
always take the latest SAST artifact available. Behind the scenes, the
[GitLab SAST Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast)
is used to detect the languages/frameworks and in turn runs the matching scan tools.

### Customizing the SAST settings

The SAST settings can be changed through environment variables by using the
[`variables`](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#variables) parameter in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
These variables are documented in the
[SAST tool documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast#settings).

In the following example, we include the SAST template and at the same time we
set the `SAST_GOSEC_LEVEL` variable to `2`:

```yaml
include:
  template: SAST.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  SAST_GOSEC_LEVEL: 2
```

Because the template is [evaluated before](../../../ci/yaml/README.md#include)
the pipeline configuration, the last mention of the variable will take precedence.

#### Using a variable to pass username and password to a private Maven repository

If you have a private Apache Maven repository that requires login credentials,
you can use the `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` [environment variable](#available-variables)
to pass a username and password. You can set it under your project's settings
so that your credentials aren't exposed in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

If the username is `myuser` and the password is `verysecret` then you would
set the following [variable](../../../ci/variables/README.md#via-the-ui)
under your project's settings:

| Type | Key | Value |
| ---- | --- | ----- |
| Variable | `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` | `-Drepository.password=verysecret -Drepository.user=myuser` |

### Overriding the SAST template

If you want to override the job definition (for example, change properties like
`variables` or `dependencies`), you need to declare a `sast` job after the
template inclusion and specify any additional keys under it. For example:

```yaml
include:
  template: SAST.gitlab-ci.yml

sast:
  variables:
    CI_DEBUG_TRACE: "true"
```

### Available variables

SAST can be [configured](#customizing-the-sast-settings) using environment variables.

#### Docker images

The following are Docker image-related variables.

| Environment variable          | Description                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGES`        | Comma separated list of custom images. Default images are still enabled. Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md).       |
| `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX`  | Override the name of the Docker registry providing the default images (proxy). Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md). |
| `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TAG`     | Override the Docker tag of the default images. Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md).                                 |
| `SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS`      | Override the names of default images. Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md).                                          |
| `SAST_PULL_ANALYZER_IMAGES`   | Pull the images from the Docker registry (set to 0 to disable). Read more about [customizing analyzers](analyzers.md).                 |

### Vulnerability filters

Some analyzers make it possible to filter out vulnerabilities under a given threshold.

| Environment variable | Default value | Description | Example usage |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------|---|
| `SAST_BANDIT_EXCLUDED_PATHS`  | -   | comma-separated list of paths to exclude from scan. Uses Python's [`fnmatch` syntax](https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html) | |
| `SAST_BRAKEMAN_LEVEL`   |         1 | Ignore Brakeman vulnerabilities under given confidence level. Integer, 1=Low 3=High. | |
| `SAST_FLAWFINDER_LEVEL` |         1 | Ignore Flawfinder vulnerabilities under given risk level. Integer, 0=No risk, 5=High risk. | |
| `SAST_GITLEAKS_ENTROPY_LEVEL` | 8.0 | Minimum entropy for secret detection. Float, 0.0 = low, 8.0 = high. | |
| `SAST_GOSEC_LEVEL`      |         0 | Ignore gosec vulnerabilities under given confidence level. Integer, 0=Undefined, 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High. | |
| `SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS`   |   -        | Exclude vulnerabilities from output based on the paths. This is a comma-separated list of patterns. Patterns can be globs, file or folder paths. Parent directories will also match patterns. | `SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS=doc,spec` |

### Timeouts

The following variables configure timeouts.

| Environment variable | Default value | Description |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `SAST_DOCKER_CLIENT_NEGOTIATION_TIMEOUT` |      2m | Time limit for Docker client negotiation. Timeouts are parsed using Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration). Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". For example, "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". |
| `SAST_PULL_ANALYZER_IMAGE_TIMEOUT`       |      5m | Time limit when pulling the image of an analyzer. Timeouts are parsed using Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration). Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". For example, "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". |
| `SAST_RUN_ANALYZER_TIMEOUT`              |     20m | Time limit when running an analyzer. Timeouts are parsed using Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration). Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". For example, "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m".|

### Analyzer settings

Some analyzers can be customized with environment variables.

| Environment variable    | Analyzer | Description |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|
| `ANT_HOME`              | spotbugs | The `ANT_HOME` environment variable. |

| `FAIL_NEVER`            | spotbugs | Set to `1` to ignore compilation failure. |

## Reports JSON format

CAUTION: **Caution:**
The JSON report artifacts are not a public API of SAST and their format may change in the future.

The SAST tool emits a JSON report report file. Here is an example of the report structure with all important parts of

| `vulnerabilities[].identifiers[].url`   | URL to identifier's documentation. Optional. |

## Secret detection

GitLab is also able to detect secrets and credentials that have been unintentionally pushed to the repository.
For example, an API key that allows write access to third-party deployment environments.

This check is performed by a specific analyzer during the `sast` job. It runs regardless of the programming
language of your app, and you don't need to change anything to your
CI/CD configuration file to turn it on. Results are available in the SAST report.

GitLab currently includes [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) and [TruffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) checks.

## Security Dashboard

The Security Dashboard is a good place to get an overview of all the security
vulnerabilities in your groups, projects and pipelines. Read more about the
[Security Dashboard](../security_dashboard/index.md).

## Interacting with the vulnerabilities

Once a vulnerability is found, you can interact with it. Read more on how to
[interact with the vulnerabilities](../index.md#interacting-with-the-vulnerabilities).

## Vulnerabilities database update

For more information about the vulnerabilities database update, check the
[maintenance table](../index.md#maintenance-and-update-of-the-vulnerabilities-database).
