# Use of GET request method with sensitive query strings (password)

## Description

The user's password was identified in the request URL. Passwords should never be sent in GET
requests as they maybe captured by proxy systems, stored in browser history, or stored in
log files. If an attacker were to get access to these logs or logging systems, they would
be able to gain access to the target account.

## Remediation

Passwords should never be sent in GET requests. When authenticating users or requesting users
reset their passwords, always use POST requests to transmit sensitive data.
