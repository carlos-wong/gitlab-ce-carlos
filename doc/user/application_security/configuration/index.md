# Security Configuration **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20711) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.6.

## Overview

The security configuration page displays the configuration state of each of the security
features and can be accessed through a project's sidebar nav.

The page uses the project's latest default branch [CI pipeline](../../../ci/pipelines.md) to determine the configuration
state of each feature. If a job with the expected security report artifact exists in the pipeline,
the feature is considered configured.

NOTE: **Note:** if the latest pipeline used [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md),
all security features will be configured by default.

## Limitations

It is not possible to enable or disable a feature using the configuration page.
However, instructions on how to enable or disable a feature can be found through
the links next to each feature on that page.
