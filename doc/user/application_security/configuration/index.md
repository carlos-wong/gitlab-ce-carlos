The Security Configuration page lists the following for the security testing and compliance tools:

- Name, description, and a documentation link.
- Whether or not it is available.
- A configuration button or a link to its configuration guide.

The status of each security control is determined by the project's latest default branch
[CI pipeline](../../../ci/pipelines/index.md).
If a job with the expected security report artifact exists in the pipeline, the feature's status is
_enabled_.

If the latest pipeline used [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.md),
all security features are configured by default.

To view a project's security configuration:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Security & Compliance > Configuration**.

Select **Configuration history** to see the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file's history.
