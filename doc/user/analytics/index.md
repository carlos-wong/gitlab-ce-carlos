# Analytics workspace

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12077) in GitLab 12.2 (enabled using `analytics` feature flag).

The Analytics workspace will make it possible to aggregate analytics across
GitLab, so that users can view information across multiple projects and groups
in one place.

To access the centralized analytics workspace:

1. Ensure it's enabled. Requires a GitLab administrator to enable it with the `analytics` feature
   flag.
1. Once enabled, click on **Analytics** from the top navigation bar.

NOTE: **Note:**
Project-level Cycle Analytics are still available at a project's **Project > Cycle Analytics**.
