# User account **(FREE)**

Each GitLab account has a user profile, which contains information about you and your GitLab activity.

Your profile also includes settings, which you use to customize your GitLab experience.

## Access your user profile

To access your profile:

1. On the top bar, in the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select your name or username.

## Access your user settings

To access your user settings:

1. On the top bar, in the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.

## Change your password

To change your password:

1. On the top bar, in the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Password**.
1. In the **Current password** text box, enter your current password.
1. In the **New password** and **Password confirmation** text box, enter your new password.
1. Select **Save password**.

If you don't know your current password, select the **I forgot my password** link.

## Change your username

Your username has a unique [namespace](../group/index.md#namespaces),
which is updated when you change your username. Before you change your username, read about
[how redirects behave](../project/repository/index.md#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes).
If you do not want to update the namespace, you can create a new user or group and transfer projects to it instead.

Prerequisites:

- Your namespace cannot contain a project with [Container Registry](../packages/container_registry/index.md) tags.
- Your namespace cannot have a project that hosts [GitLab Pages](../project/pages/index.md). For more information,
  see [this procedure in the GitLab Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#change-your-username-at-gitlabcom).

To change your username:

1. On the top bar, in the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Account**.
1. In the **Change username** section, enter a new username as the path.
1. Select **Update username**.

## Add emails to your user profile

To add new email to your account:

1. On the top bar, in the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Emails**.
1. In the **Email** text box, enter the new email.
1. Select **Add email address**.
1. Verify your email address with the verification email received.

## Make your user profile page private

You can make your user profile visible to only you and GitLab administrators.

To make your profile private:

1. On the top bar, in the top-right corner, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. Select the **Private profile** checkbox.
1. Select **Update profile settings**.

The following is hidden from your user profile page (`https://gitlab.example.com/username`):

- Atom feed
- Date when account was created
- Tabs for activity, groups, contributed projects, personal projects, starred projects, snippets

NOTE:
Making your user profile page private does not hide all your public resources from the REST or GraphQL APIs.

### User visibility

The public page of a user, located at `/username`, is always visible whether you are signed-in or
not.

When visiting the public page of a user, you can only see the projects which you have privileges to.

If the [public level is restricted](../admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#restrict-visibility-levels),
user profiles are only visible to signed-in users.

## Add details to your profile with a README

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232157) in GitLab 14.5.

You can add more information to your profile page with a README file. When you populate
the README file with information, it's included on your profile page.

### From a new project

To create a new project and add its README to your profile:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Project**.
1. Select **Create new project**.
1. Select **Create blank project**.
1. Enter the project details:
   - In the **Project name** field, enter the name for your new project.
   - In the **Project URL** field, select your GitLab username.
   - In the **Project slug** field, enter your GitLab username.
1. For **Visibility Level**, select **Public**.
   ![Proper project path for an individual on the hosted product](img/personal_readme_setup_v14_5.png)
1. For **Project Configuration**, ensure **Initialize repository with a README** is selected.
1. Select **Create project**.
1. Create a README file inside this project. The file can be any valid [README or index file](../project/repository/index.md#readme-and-index-files).
1. Populate the README file with [Markdown](../markdown.md), or another [supported markup language](../project/repository/index.md#supported-markup-languages).

GitLab displays the contents of your README below your contribution graph.

### From an existing project

To add the README from an existing project to your profile,
[update the path](../project/settings/index.md#renaming-a-repository) of the project
to match your username.

## Troubleshooting

### Why do I keep getting signed out?

When you sign in to the main GitLab application, a `_gitlab_session` cookie is
set. When you close your browser, the cookie is cleared client-side
and it expires after "Application settings > Session duration (minutes)"/`session_expire_delay`
(defaults to `10080` minutes = 7 days) of no activity.

When you sign in to the main GitLab application, you can also check the
**Remember me** option. This sets the `remember_user_token`
cookie via [`devise`](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise).
The `remember_user_token` cookie expires after
`config/initializers/devise.rb` -> `config.remember_for`. The default is 2 weeks.

When the `_gitlab_session` expires or isn't available, GitLab uses the `remember_user_token`
to get you a new `_gitlab_session` and keep you signed in through browser restarts.

After your `remember_user_token` expires and your `_gitlab_session` is cleared/expired,
you are asked to sign in again to verify your identity for security reasons.

NOTE:
When any session is signed out, or when a session is revoked
via [Active Sessions](active_sessions.md), all **Remember me** tokens are revoked.
While other sessions remain active, the **Remember me** feature doesn't restore
a session if the browser is closed or the existing session expires.

### Increased sign-in time

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/20340) in GitLab 13.1.

The `remember_user_token` lifetime of a cookie can now extend beyond the deadline set by `config.remember_for`, as the `config.extend_remember_period` flag is now set to true.

GitLab uses both session and persistent cookies:

- Session cookie: Session cookies are normally removed at the end of the browser session when
  the browser is closed. The `_gitlab_session` cookie has no fixed expiration date. However,
  it expires based on its [`session_expire_delay`](#why-do-i-keep-getting-signed-out).
- Persistent cookie: The `remember_user_token` is a cookie with an expiration date of two weeks.
  GitLab activates this cookie if you select **Remember Me** when you sign in.

By default, the server sets a time-to-live (TTL) of 1-week on any session that is used.

When you close a browser, the session cookie may still remain. For example, Chrome has the "Continue where you left off" option that restores session cookies.
In other words, as long as you access GitLab at least once every 2 weeks, you could remain signed in with GitLab, as long as your browser tab is open.
The server continues to reset the TTL for that session, independent of whether 2FA is installed,
If you close your browser and open it up again, the `remember_user_token` cookie allows your user to reauthenticate itself.

Without the `config.extend_remember_period` flag, you would be forced to sign in again after two weeks.
