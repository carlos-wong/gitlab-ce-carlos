# User account

Each GitLab account has a user profile, and settings. Your [profile](#user-profile)
contains information about you, and your GitLab activity. Your [settings](#profile-settings)
allow you to customize some aspects of GitLab to suit yourself.

## Creating users

There are several ways to create users on GitLab. See the [creating users documentation](account/create_accounts.md) for more details.

## Signing in

There are several ways to sign into your GitLab account.
See the [authentication topic](../../topics/authentication/index.md) for more details.

## User profile

1. Click on your avatar.
1. Select **Profile**.

On your profile page, you will see the following information:

- Personal information
- Activity stream: see your activity streamline and the history of your contributions
- Groups: [groups](../group/index.md) you're a member of
- Contributed projects: [projects](../project/index.md) you contributed to

- Access your audit log, a security log of important events involving your account

## Changing your username

Your `username` is a unique [`namespace`](../group/index.md#namespaces)
related to your user ID. Changing it can have unintended side effects, read
[how redirects will behave](../project/index.md#redirects-when-changing-repository-paths)
before proceeding.

To change your `username`:

1. Navigate to your [profile's](#profile-settings) **Settings > Account**.
1. Enter a new username under **Change username**.
1. Click **Update username**.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
It is currently not possible to change your username if it contains a
project with [Container Registry](../packages/container_registry/index.md) tags,
because the project cannot be moved.

TIP: **Tip:**
If you want to retain ownership over the original namespace and
protect the URL redirects, then instead of changing a group's path or renaming a
username, you can create a new group and transfer projects to it.
Alternatively, you can follow [this detailed procedure from the GitLab Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#how-to-change-your-username-at-gitlabcom)
which also covers the case where you have projects hosted with
[GitLab Pages](../project/pages/index.md).

## Private profile

## Current status

> Introduced in GitLab 11.2.

You can provide a custom status message for your user profile along with an emoji that describes it.
This may be helpful when you are out of office or otherwise not available.
Other users can then take your status into consideration when responding to your issues or assigning work to you.
Please be aware that your status is publicly visible even if your [profile is private](#private-profile).

Status messages are restricted to 100 characters of plain text.
They may however contain emoji codes such as `I'm on vacation :palm_tree:`.

To set your current status:

1. Click your avatar.
1. Click **Set status**, or **Edit status** if you have already set a status.

1. Click **Update profile settings**.

You can also set your current status [using the API](../../api/users.md#user-status).

## Commit email

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/21598) in GitLab 11.4.

A commit email is an email address displayed in every Git-related action carried out through the GitLab interface.

Any of your own verified email addresses can be used as the commit email.

To change your commit email:

1. Click your avatar.
1. Select **Profile**.
1. Click **Edit profile** (pencil icon).
1. Click **Commit email** dropdown.
1. Select any of the verified emails.
1. Click **Update profile settings**.

### Private commit email

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/22560) in GitLab 11.5.

GitLab provides the user with an automatically generated private commit email option,
which allows the user to keep their email information private.

To enable this option:

1. Click your avatar.
1. Select **Profile**.
1. Click **Edit profile** (pencil icon).
1. Click **Commit email** dropdown.
1. Select **Use a private email** option.
1. Click **Update profile settings**.

Once this option is enabled, every Git-related action will be performed using the private commit email.

To stay fully anonymous, you can also copy this private commit email
and configure it on your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git config --global user.email <your email address>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Why do I keep getting signed out?

When signing in to the main GitLab application, a `_gitlab_session` cookie is
set. `_gitlab_session` is cleared client-side when you close your browser
and expires after "Application settings -> Session duration (minutes)"/`session_expire_delay`
(defaults to `10080` minutes = 7 days).

When signing in to the main GitLab application, you can also check the
"Remember me" option which sets the `remember_user_token`
cookie (via [`devise`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)).
`remember_user_token` expires after
`config/initializers/devise.rb` -> `config.remember_for` (defaults to 2 weeks).

When the `_gitlab_session` expires or isn't available, GitLab uses the `remember_user_token`
to get you a new `_gitlab_session` and keep you signed in through browser restarts.

After your `remember_user_token` expires and your `_gitlab_session` is cleared/expired,
you will be asked to sign in again to verify your identity (which is for security reasons).

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
