# Jupyter Notebook Files

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/2508/) in GitLab 9.1.

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook (previously IPython Notebook) files are used for
interactive computing in many fields and contain a complete record of the
user's sessions and include code, narrative text, equations and rich output.

When added to a repository, Jupyter Notebooks with a `.ipynb` extension will be
rendered to HTML when viewed.

Interactive features, including JavaScript plots, will not work when viewed in
GitLab.
