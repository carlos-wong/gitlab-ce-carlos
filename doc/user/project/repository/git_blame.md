# Git file blame

> [Introduced](https://git.sphere.ly/staff/publicgitlab/commit/39c657930625ddc3ac8a921f01ffc83acadce68f) in GitLab 2.5

[Git blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) provides more information
about every line in a file, including the last modified time, author, and
commit hash.

You can find the **Blame** button with each file in a project.

When you select the **Blame** button, you'll see a screen with the
noted information:

If you hover over a commit in the UI, you'll see a precise date and time
for that commit.

## Blame previous commit

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/19299) in GitLab 12.7.

To see earlier revisions of a specific line, click **View blame prior to this change**
until you've found the changes you're interested in viewing:

## Associated `git` command

If you're running `git` from the command line, the equivalent command is
`git blame <filename>`. For example, if you want to find `blame` information
about a `README.md` file in the local directory, run the following command:

```shell
git blame README.md
```

You'll see output similar to the following, which includes the commit time
in UTC format:
