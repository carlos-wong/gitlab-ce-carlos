# Organize work with projects **(FREE)**

In GitLab, you can create projects to host
your codebase. You can also use projects to track issues, plan work,
collaborate on code, and continuously build, test, and use
built-in CI/CD to deploy your app.

Projects can be available [publicly, internally, or privately](../public_access.md).
GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you can create.

## Project features

Projects include the following [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/):

**Repositories:**

- [Issue tracker](issues/index.md): Discuss implementations with your team.
  - [Issue boards](issue_board.md): Organize and prioritize your workflow.
  - [Multiple issue boards](issue_board.md#multiple-issue-boards): Create team-specific workflows (issue boards) for a project.
- [Repositories](repository/index.md): Host your code in a fully-integrated platform.
  - [Branches](repository/branches/index.md): Use Git branching strategies to
  collaborate on code.
  - [Protected branches](protected_branches.md): Prevent collaborators
  from changing history or pushing code without review.
  - [Protected tags](protected_tags.md): Control who has
  permission to create tags and prevent accidental updates or deletions.
  - [Repository mirroring](repository/mirror/index.md)
  - [Signing commits](repository/gpg_signed_commits/index.md): Use GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) to sign your commits.

  vulnerability in your project.

- [Issue tracker](issues/index.md): Discuss implementations with your team.
  - [Issue boards](issue_board.md): Organize and prioritize your workflow.
  - [Multiple issue boards](issue_board.md#multiple-issue-boards): Create team-specific workflows (issue boards) for a project.
- [Merge requests](merge_requests/index.md): Apply a branching
  strategy and get reviewed by your team.

- [Time Tracking](time_tracking.md): Track time estimated and
  spent on issues and merge requests.
- [Milestones](milestones/index.md): Work toward a target date.
- [Description templates](description_templates.md): Define context-specific
  templates for issue and merge request description fields.
- [Slash commands (quick actions)](quick_actions.md): Create text shortcuts for
  common actions.

  references to users, groups, issues, merge requests, and other GitLab
  elements.

## Project integrations

[Integrate your project](integrations/index.md) with Jira, Mattermost,
Kubernetes, Slack, and a lot more.

## Import or export a project

- [Import a project](import/index.md) from:
  - [GitHub to GitLab](import/github.md)
  - [Bitbucket to GitLab](import/bitbucket.md)
  - [Gitea to GitLab](import/gitea.md)
  - [FogBugz to GitLab](import/fogbugz.md)
- [Export a project from GitLab](settings/import_export.md#export-a-project-and-its-data)
- [Importing and exporting projects between GitLab instances](settings/import_export.md)

## GitLab Workflow - VS Code extension

To avoid switching from the GitLab UI and VS Code while working in GitLab repositories, you can integrate
the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor with GitLab through the
[GitLab Workflow extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow).

To review or contribute to the extension's code, visit [its codebase in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/).
