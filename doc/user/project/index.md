# Projects

In GitLab, you can create projects for hosting
your codebase, use it as an issue tracker, collaborate on code, and continuously
build, test, and deploy your app with built-in GitLab CI/CD.

Your projects can be [available](../../public_access/public_access.md)
publicly, internally, or privately, at your choice. GitLab does not limit
the number of private projects you create.

## Project features

When you create a project in GitLab, you'll have access to a large number of

### Project integrations

[Integrate your project](integrations/index.md) with Jira, Mattermost,
Kubernetes, Slack, and a lot more.

## New project

Learn how to [create a new project](../../gitlab-basics/create-project.md) in GitLab.

### Fork a project

You can [fork a project](repository/forking_workflow.md) in order to:

- Collaborate on code by forking a project and creating a merge request
  from your fork to the upstream project
- Fork a sample project to work on the top of that

### Star a project

You can star a project to make it easier to find projects you frequently use.
The number of stars a project has can indicate its popularity.

To star a project:

1. Go to the home page of the project you want to star.
1. In the upper right corner of the page, click **Star**.

To view your starred projects:

1. Click **Projects** in the navigation bar.
1. Click **Starred Projects**.
1. GitLab displays information about your starred projects, including:

   - Project description, including name, description, and icon
   - Number of times this project has been starred
   - Number of times this project has been forked
   - Number of open merge requests
   - Number of open issues

## Project settings

Set the project's visibility level and the access levels to its various pages
and perform actions like archiving, renaming or transferring a project.

Read through the documentation on [project settings](settings/index.md).

## Import or export a project

- [Import a project](import/index.md) from:
  - [GitHub to GitLab](import/github.md)
  - [Bitbucket to GitLab](import/bitbucket.md)
  - [Gitea to GitLab](import/gitea.md)
  - [FogBugz to GitLab](import/fogbugz.md)
- [Export a project from GitLab](settings/import_export.md#exporting-a-project-and-its-data)
- [Importing and exporting projects between GitLab instances](settings/import_export.md)

## CI/CD for external repositories **(PREMIUM)**

Instead of importing a repository directly to GitLab, you can connect your repository
as a CI/CD project.

Read through the documentation on [CI/CD for external repositories](../../ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/index.md).

## Project members

Learn how to [add members to your projects](members/index.md).

### Leave a project

**Leave project** will only display on the project's dashboard
when a project is part of a group (under a
[group namespace](../group/index.md#namespaces)).
If you choose to leave a project you will no longer be a project
member, therefore, unable to contribute.

## Project's landing page

The project's landing page shows different information depending on
the project's visibility settings and user permissions.

For public projects, and to members of internal and private projects
with [permissions to view the project's code](../permissions.md#project-members-permissions):

- The content of a
  [`README` or an index file](repository/#repository-readme-and-index-files)
  is displayed (if any), followed by the list of directories within the
  project's repository.
- If the project doesn't contain either of these files, the
  visitor will see the list of files and directories of the repository.

For users without permissions to view the project's code:

- The wiki homepage is displayed, if any.
- The list of issues within the project is displayed.

## Redirects when changing repository paths

When a repository path changes, it is essential to smoothly transition from the
old location to the new one. GitLab provides two kinds of redirects: the web UI
and Git push/pull redirects.

Depending on the situation, different things apply.

When [renaming a user](../profile/index.md#changing-your-username),
[changing a group path](../group/index.md#changing-a-groups-path) or [renaming a repository](settings/index.md#renaming-a-repository):

- Existing web URLs for the namespace and anything under it (e.g., projects) will
  redirect to the new URLs.
- Starting with GitLab 10.3, existing Git remote URLs for projects under the
  namespace will redirect to the new remote URL. Every time you push/pull to a
  repository that has changed its location, a warning message to update
  your remote will be displayed instead of rejecting your action.
  This means that any automation scripts, or Git clients will continue to
  work after a rename, making any transition a lot smoother.
- The redirects will be available as long as the original path is not claimed by
  another group, user or project.

## Use your project as a Go package

Any project can be used as a Go package including private projects in subgroups.
GitLab responds correctly to `go get` and `godoc.org` discovery requests,
including the [`go-import`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths)
and [`go-source`](https://github.com/golang/gddo/wiki/Source-Code-Links) meta
tags, respectively. To use packages hosted in private projects with the `go get`
command, use a [`.netrc` file](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl-netrc.html) and a
[personal access token](../profile/personal_access_tokens.md) in the password
field.

For example:

```text
machine example.gitlab.com
login <gitlab_user_name>
password <personal_access_token>
```

## Access project page with project ID

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/53671) in GitLab 11.8.

To quickly access a project from the GitLab UI using the project ID,
visit the `/projects/:id` URL in your browser or other tool accessing the project.

## Project aliases **(PREMIUM ONLY)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/3264) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.1.

When migrating repositories to GitLab and they are being accessed by other systems,
it's very useful to be able to access them using the same name especially when
they are a lot. It reduces the risk of changing significant number of Git URLs in
a large number of systems.

GitLab provides a functionality to help with this. In GitLab, repositories are
usually accessed with a namespace and project name. It is also possible to access
them via a project alias. This feature is only available on Git over SSH.

A project alias can be only created via API and only by GitLab administrators.
Follow the [Project Aliases API documentation](../../api/project_aliases.md) for
more details.

Once an alias has been created for a project (e.g., an alias `gitlab` for the
project `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab`), the repository can be cloned
using the alias (e.g `git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab.git` instead of
`git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/gitlab.git`).

## Project APIs

There are numerous [APIs](../../api/README.md) to use with your projects:

- [Badges](../../api/project_badges.md)
- [Clusters](../../api/project_clusters.md)
- [Threads](../../api/discussions.md)
- [General](../../api/projects.md)
- [Import/export](../../api/project_import_export.md)
