# Getting started with Container Host Security **(FREE)**

> [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7476) in GitLab 14.8, and planned for [removal](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7477) in GitLab 15.0.

WARNING:
Container Host Security is in its end-of-life process. It's [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7476)
in GitLab 14.8, and planned for [removal](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7477)
in GitLab 15.0.

The following steps are recommended for installing Container Host Security.

## Installation steps

The following steps are recommended to install and use Container Host Security through GitLab:

1. [Install at least one runner and connect it to GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).
1. [Create a group](../../../../group/#create-a-group).
1. [Connect a Kubernetes cluster to the group](../../add_remove_clusters.md).
1. [Create a cluster management project and associate it with the Kubernetes cluster](../../../../clusters/management_project.md).

1. Install and configure an Ingress node:

   - [Install the Ingress node via CI/CD (Cluster Management Project)](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-ingress-using-gitlab-cicd).
   - Navigate to the Kubernetes page and enter the [DNS address for the external endpoint](../../gitlab_managed_clusters.md#base-domain)
     into the **Base domain** field on the **Details** tab. Save the changes to the Kubernetes
     cluster.

1. [Install and configure Falco](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-falco-using-gitlab-cicd)
   for activity monitoring.
1. [Install and configure AppArmor](../../../../clusters/applications.md#install-apparmor-using-gitlab-cicd)
   for activity blocking.
1. [Configure Pod Security Policies](../../../../clusters/applications.md#using-podsecuritypolicy-in-your-deployments)
   (required to be able to load AppArmor profiles).

It's possible to install and manage Falco and AppArmor in other ways, such as installing them
manually in a Kubernetes cluster and then connecting it back to GitLab. These methods aren't
supported or documented.

## Viewing the logs

Falco logs can be viewed by running the following command in your Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
kubectl -n gitlab-managed-apps logs -l app=falco
```

## Troubleshooting

### Trouble connecting to the cluster

Your CI/CD pipeline may occasionally fail or have trouble connecting to the cluster. Here are some
initial troubleshooting steps that resolve the most common problems:

1. [Clear the cluster cache](../../gitlab_managed_clusters.md#clearing-the-cluster-cache)
1. If things still aren't working, a more assertive set of actions may help get things back to a
   good state:

   - Stop and [delete the problematic environment](../../../../../ci/environments/#delete-a-stopped-environment)
     in GitLab.
   - Delete the relevant namespace in Kubernetes by running
     `kubectl delete namespaces <insert-some-namespace-name>` in your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Rerun the application project pipeline to redeploy the application.
