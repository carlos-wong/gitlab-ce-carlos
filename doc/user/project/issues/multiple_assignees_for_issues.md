# Multiple assignees for issues **(PREMIUM)**

> Moved from Starter to Premium in GitLab 13.9.

In large teams with shared ownership, it can be difficult
to track who is working on an issue, who's already done, or who hasn't started yet.

You can add multiple [assignees](managing_issues.md#assignee) to an issue, making it easier to
track, and making clearer who is accountable for it.

Multiple assignees for issues makes collaboration smoother,
and allows shared responsibilities to be clearly displayed.
All assignees are shown across your team's workflows and receive notifications (as they
would as single assignees), simplifying communication and ownership.

After an assignee completes their work, they remove themselves as an assignee, making
it clear that their task is complete.
