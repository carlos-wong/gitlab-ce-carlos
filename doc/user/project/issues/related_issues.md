# Related issues **(STARTER)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/1797) in [GitLab Starter](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 9.4.

Related issues are a bi-directional relationship between any two issues
and appear in a block below the issue description. Issues can be across groups
and projects.

The relationship only shows up in the UI if the user can see both issues.

## Adding a related issue

You can relate one issue to another by clicking the related issues "+" button
in the header of the related issue block. Then, input the issue reference number
or paste in the full URL of the issue.

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/2035) in GitLab 12.8.

Additionally, you can select whether the current issue relates to, blocks, or is blocked by the issues being entered.

Issues of the same project can be specified just by the reference number.
Issues from a different project require additional information like the
group and the project name. For example:

- same project: `#44`
- same group: `project#44`
- different group: `group/project#44`

Valid references will be added to a temporary list that you can review.
When you have added all the related issues, click **Add** to submit.

Once you have finished adding all related issues, you will be able to see
them categorized so their relationships can be better understood visually.

## Removing a related issue

In the related issues block, click the "x" icon on the right-side of each issue
token that you wish to remove. Due to the bi-directional relationship, it
will no longer appear in either issue.
