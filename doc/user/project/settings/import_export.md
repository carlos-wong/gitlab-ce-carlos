# Project import/export **(FREE)**

Existing projects on any self-managed GitLab instance or GitLab.com can be exported to a file and
then imported into a new GitLab instance.

## Set up project import/export

Before you can import or export a project and its data, you must set it up.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Visibility and access controls**.
1. Scroll to **Import sources**.
1. Enable the desired **Import sources**.

## Between CE and EE

You can export projects from the [Community Edition to the Enterprise Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/)
and vice versa. This assumes [version history](#version-history)
requirements are met.

If you're exporting a project from the Enterprise Edition to the Community Edition, you may lose
data that is retained only in the Enterprise Edition. For more information, see
[downgrading from EE to CE](../../../index.md).

## Export a project and its data

Before you can import a project, you must export it.

Prerequisites:

- Review the list of [data that will be exported](#items-that-are-exported).
  Not all data is exported.
- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

To export a project and its data, follow these steps:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings**.
1. Expand **Advanced**.
1. Select **Export project**.
1. After the export is generated, you should receive an email with a link to download the file.
1. Alternatively, you can come back to the project settings and download the file from there or
   generate a new export. After the file is available, the page should show the **Download export**
   button.

The export is generated in your configured `shared_path`, a temporary shared directory, and then
moved to your configured `uploads_directory`. Every 24 hours, a worker deletes these export files.

### Items that are exported

The following items are exported:

- Project and wiki repositories
- Project uploads
- Project configuration, excluding integrations
- Issues with comments, merge requests with diffs and comments, labels, milestones, snippets, time
  tracking, and other project entities
- Design Management files and data
- LFS objects
- Issue boards
- Pipelines history
- Push Rules
- Awards
- Group members are exported as project members, as long as the user has the Maintainer role in the
  exported project's group, or is an administrator

The following items are **not** exported:

- [Child pipeline history](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221088)
- Build traces and artifacts
- Container registry images
- CI/CD variables
- Pipeline triggers
- Webhooks
- Any encrypted tokens
- Merge Request Approvers and [the number of required approvals](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221088)
- Repository size limits
- Deploy keys allowed to push to protected branches

These content rules also apply to creating projects from templates on the
[group](../../group/custom_project_templates.md)
or [instance](../../admin_area/custom_project_templates.md)
levels, because the same export and import mechanisms are used.

NOTE:
For more details on the specific data persisted in a project export, see the
[`import_export.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/import_export/project/import_export.yml) file.

## Import a project and its data

> Default maximum import file size [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251106) from 50 MB to unlimited in GitLab 13.8.

WARNING:
Only import projects from sources you trust. If you import a project from an untrusted source, it
may be possible for an attacker to steal your sensitive data.

Prerequisites:

- You must have [exported the project and its data](#export-a-project-and-its-data).
- Compare GitLab versions and ensure you are importing to a GitLab version that is the same or later
  than the GitLab version you exported to.
- Review the [Version history](#version-history)
  for compatibility issues.

To import a project:

1. When [creating a new project](../working_with_projects.md#create-a-project),
   select **Import project**.
1. In **Import project from**, select **GitLab export**.
1. Enter your project name and URL. Then select the file you exported previously.
1. Select **Import project** to begin importing. Your newly imported project page appears shortly.

To get the status of an import, you can query it through the [Project import/export API](../../../api/project_import_export.md#import-status).
As described in the API documentation, the query may return an import error or exceptions.

### Items that are imported

The following items are imported but changed slightly:

- Project members with the Owner role are imported as Maintainers.
- If an imported project contains merge requests originating from forks, then new branches
  associated with such merge requests are created in a project during the import/export. Thus, the
  number of branches in the exported project might be bigger than in the original project.
- If use of the `Internal` visibility level
  [is restricted](../../public_access.md#restrict-use-of-public-or-internal-projects),
  all imported projects are given `Private` visibility.

Deploy keys aren't imported. To use deploy keys, you must enable them in your imported project and update protected branches.

### Import large projects **(FREE SELF)**

If you have a larger project, consider using a Rake task as described in the [developer documentation](../../../development/import_project.md#importing-via-a-rake-task).

## Automate group and project import **(PREMIUM)**

For information on automating user, group, and project import API calls, see
[Automate group and project import](../import/index.md#automate-group-and-project-import).

## Maximum import file size

Administrators can set the maximum import file size one of two ways:

- With the `max_import_size` option in the [Application settings API](../../../api/settings.md#change-application-settings).
- In the [Admin Area UI](../../admin_area/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#max-import-size).

The default is `0` (unlimited).

## Map users for import

Imported users can be mapped by their public email addresses on self-managed instances, if an administrator (not an owner) does the import.

- The project must be exported by a project or group member with the Owner role.
- Public email addresses are not set by default. Users must [set it in their profiles](../../profile/index.md#set-your-public-email)
  for mapping to work correctly.
- For contributions to be mapped correctly, users must be an existing member of the namespace,
  or they can be added as a member of the project. Otherwise, a supplementary comment is left to mention that the original author and the MRs, notes, or issues that are owned by the importer.
- Imported users are set as [direct members](../members/index.md)
  in the imported project.

For project migration imports performed over GitLab.com groups, preserving author information is
possible through a [professional services engagement](https://about.gitlab.com/services/migration/).

## Rate Limits

To help avoid abuse, by default, users are rate limited to:

| Request Type     | Limit |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Export           | 6 projects per minute |
| Download export  | 1 download per group per minute |
| Import           | 6 projects per minute |

GitLab.com may have [different settings](../../gitlab_com/index.md#importexport)
from the defaults.

## Version history

### 14.0+

In GitLab 14.0, the JSON format is no longer supported for project and group exports. To allow for a
transitional period, you can still import any JSON exports. The new format for imports and exports
is NDJSON.

### 13.0+

Starting with GitLab 13.0, GitLab can import bundles that were exported from a different GitLab deployment.
This ability is limited to two previous GitLab [minor](../../../policy/maintenance.md#versioning)
releases, which is similar to our process for [Security Releases](../../../policy/maintenance.md#security-releases).

For example:

| Current version | Can import bundles exported from |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| 13.0            | 13.0, 12.10, 12.9                |
| 13.1            | 13.1, 13.0, 12.10                |

### 12.x

Prior to 13.0 this was a defined compatibility table:

| Exporting GitLab version   | Importing GitLab version   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 11.7 to 12.10              | 11.7 to 12.10              |
| 11.1 to 11.6               | 11.1 to 11.6               |
| 10.8 to 11.0               | 10.8 to 11.0               |
| 10.4 to 10.7               | 10.4 to 10.7               |
| 10.3                       | 10.3                       |
| 10.0 to 10.2               | 10.0 to 10.2               |
| 9.4 to 9.6                 | 9.4 to 9.6                 |
| 9.2 to 9.3                 | 9.2 to 9.3                 |
| 8.17 to 9.1                | 8.17 to 9.1                |
| 8.13 to 8.16               | 8.13 to 8.16               |
| 8.12                       | 8.12                       |
| 8.10.3 to 8.11             | 8.10.3 to 8.11             |
| 8.10.0 to 8.10.2           | 8.10.0 to 8.10.2           |
| 8.9.5 to 8.9.11            | 8.9.5 to 8.9.11            |
| 8.9.0 to 8.9.4             | 8.9.0 to 8.9.4             |

Projects can be exported and imported only between versions of GitLab with matching Import/Export versions.

For example, 8.10.3 and 8.11 have the same Import/Export version (0.1.3)
and the exports between them are compatible.

## Troubleshooting

### Project fails to import due to mismatch

If the [shared runners enablement](../../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#enable-shared-runners-for-a-project)
does not match between the exported project, and the project import, the project fails to import.
Review [issue 276930](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276930), and either:

- Ensure shared runners are enabled in both the source and destination projects.
- Disable shared runners on the parent group when you import the project.

### Import workarounds for large repositories

[Maximum import size limitations](#import-a-project-and-its-data)
can prevent an import from being successful. If changing the import limits is not possible, you can
try one of the workarounds listed here.

#### Workaround option 1

The following local workflow can be used to temporarily
reduce the repository size for another import attempt:

1. Create a temporary working directory from the export:

    ```shell
    EXPORT=<filename-without-extension>

    mkdir "$EXPORT"
    tar -xf "$EXPORT".tar.gz --directory="$EXPORT"/
    cd "$EXPORT"/
    git clone project.bundle

    # Prevent interference with recreating an importable file later
    mv project.bundle ../"$EXPORT"-original.bundle
    mv ../"$EXPORT".tar.gz ../"$EXPORT"-original.tar.gz

    git switch --create smaller-tmp-main
    ```

1. To reduce the repository size, work on this `smaller-tmp-main` branch:
   [identify and remove large files](../repository/reducing_the_repo_size_using_git.md)
   or [interactively rebase and fixup](../../../topics/git/git_rebase.md#interactive-rebase)
   to reduce the number of commits.

    ```shell
    # Reduce the .git/objects/pack/ file size
    cd project
    git reflog expire --expire=now --all
    git gc --prune=now --aggressive

    # Prepare recreating an importable file
    git bundle create ../project.bundle <default-branch-name>
    cd ..
    mv project/ ../"$EXPORT"-project
    cd ..

    # Recreate an importable file
    tar -czf "$EXPORT"-smaller.tar.gz --directory="$EXPORT"/ .
    ```

1. Import this new, smaller file into GitLab.
1. In a full clone of the original repository,
   use `git remote set-url origin <new-url> && git push --force --all`
   to complete the import.
1. Update the imported repository's
   [branch protection rules](../protected_branches.md) and
   its [default branch](../repository/branches/default.md), and
   delete the temporary, `smaller-tmp-main` branch, and
   the local, temporary data.

#### Workaround option 2

NOTE:
This workaround does not account for LFS objects.

Rather than attempting to push all changes at once, this workaround:

- Separates the project import from the Git Repository import
- Incrementally pushes the repository to GitLab

1. Make a local clone of the repository to migrate. In a later step, you push this clone outside of
   the project export.
1. Download the export and remove the `project.bundle` (which contains the Git repository):

   ```shell
   tar -czvf new_export.tar.gz --exclude='project.bundle' @old_export.tar.gz
   ```

1. Import the export without a Git repository. It asks you to confirm to import without a
   repository.
1. Save this bash script as a file and run it after adding the appropriate origin.

   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh

   # ASSUMPTIONS:
   # - The GitLab location is "origin"
   # - The default branch is "main"
   # - This will attempt to push in chunks of 500MB (dividing the total size by 500MB).
   #   Decrease this size to push in smaller chunks if you still receive timeouts.

   git gc
   SIZE=$(git count-objects -v 2> /dev/null | grep size-pack | awk '{print $2}')

   # Be conservative... and try to push 2GB at a time
   # (given this assumes each commit is the same size - which is wrong)
   BATCHES=$(($SIZE / 500000))
   TOTAL_COMMITS=$(git rev-list --count HEAD)
   if (( BATCHES > TOTAL_COMMITS )); then
       BATCHES=$TOTAL_COMMITS
   fi

   INCREMENTS=$(( ($TOTAL_COMMITS / $BATCHES) - 1 ))

   for (( BATCH=BATCHES; BATCH>=1; BATCH-- ))
   do
     COMMIT_NUM=$(( $BATCH - $INCREMENTS ))
     COMMIT_SHA=$(git log -n $COMMIT_NUM --format=format:%H | tail -1)
     git push -u origin ${COMMIT_SHA}:refs/heads/main
   done
   git push -u origin main
   git push -u origin --all
   git push -u origin --tags
   ```

### Manually execute export steps

Exports sometimes fail without giving enough information to troubleshoot. In these cases, it can be
helpful to [open a rails console session](../../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session)
and loop through [all the defined exporters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/b67a5b5a12498d57cd877023b7385f7251e57de8/app/services/projects/import_export/export_service.rb#L65).
Execute each line individually, rather than pasting the entire block at once, so you can see any
errors each command returns.

```shell
# User needs to have permission to export
u = User.find_by_username('someuser')
p = Project.find_by_full_path('some/project')
e = Projects::ImportExport::ExportService.new(p,u)

e.send(:version_saver).send(:save)
e.send(:repo_saver).send(:save)
## continue using `e.send(:exporter_name).send(:save)` going through the list of exporters

# The following line should show you the export_path similar to /var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/shared/tmp/gitlab_exports/@hashed/49/94/4994....
s = Gitlab::ImportExport::Saver.new(exportable: p, shared:p.import_export_shared)

# To try and upload use:
s.send(:compress_and_save)
s.send(:save_upload)
```

### Import using the REST API fails when using a group access token

[Group access tokens](../../group/settings/group_access_tokens.md)
don't work for project or group import operations. When a group access token initiates an import,
the import fails with this message:

```plaintext
Error adding importer user to Project members.
Validation failed: User project bots cannot be added to other groups / projects
```

To use [Import REST APIs](../../../api/project_import_export.md),
pass regular user account credentials such as [personal access tokens](../../profile/personal_access_tokens.md).
