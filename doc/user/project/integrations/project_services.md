# Project services

Project services allow you to integrate GitLab with other applications. They
are a bit like plugins in that they allow a lot of freedom in adding
functionality to GitLab.

## Accessing the project services

You can find the available services under your project's
**Settings âž” Integrations** page.

There are more than 20 services to integrate with. Click on the one that you
want to configure.

## Push hooks limit

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/17874) in GitLab 12.4.

If a single push includes changes to more than three branches or tags, services
supported by `push_hooks` and `tag_push_hooks` events won't be executed.

The number of branches or tags supported can be changed via
[`push_event_hooks_limit` application setting](../../../api/settings.md#list-of-settings-that-can-be-accessed-via-api-calls).

## Services templates

Services templates is a way to set some predefined values in the Service of
your liking which will then be pre-filled on each project's Service.

Read more about [Services templates in this document](services_templates.md).

## Troubleshooting project services

Some project services use service hooks for integration with external applications. To confirm which ones use service hooks, see the [services table](#services). GitLab stores details of service hook requests made within the last 2 days. To view details of the requests, go to the service's configuration page.

The **Recent Deliveries** section lists the details of each request made within the last 2 days:

- HTTP status code (green for 200-299 codes, red for the others, `internal error` for failed deliveries)
- Triggered event
- URL to which the request was sent
- Elapsed time of the request
- Relative time in which the request was made

To view more information about the request's execution, click the respective **View details** link.
On the details page, you can see the data sent by GitLab (request headers and body) and the data received by GitLab (response headers and body).

From this page, you can repeat delivery with the same data by clicking **Resend Request**.

## Contributing to project services

Because GitLab is open source we can ship with the code and tests for all
plugins. This allows the community to keep the plugins up to date so that they
always work in newer GitLab versions.

For an overview of what projects services are available, please see the
[project_services source directory][projects-code].

Contributions are welcome!
