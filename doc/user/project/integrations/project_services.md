# Project services

Project services allow you to integrate GitLab with other applications. They
are a bit like plugins in that they allow a lot of freedom in adding
functionality to GitLab.

## Accessing the project services

You can find the available services under your project's
**Settings âž” Integrations** page.

There are more than 20 services to integrate with. Click on the one that you
want to configure.

## Services templates

Services templates is a way to set some predefined values in the Service of
your liking which will then be pre-filled on each project's Service.

Read more about [Services templates in this document](services_templates.md).

## Contributing to project services

Because GitLab is open source we can ship with the code and tests for all
plugins. This allows the community to keep the plugins up to date so that they
always work in newer GitLab versions.

For an overview of what projects services are available, please see the
[project_services source directory][projects-code].

Contributions are welcome!
