# Monitoring NGINX Ingress Controller (DEPRECATED) **(FREE)**

> [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346541) in GitLab 14.7.

WARNING:
This feature is in its end-of-life process. It is [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346541)
in GitLab 14.7, and is planned for removal in GitLab 16.0.

GitLab has support for automatically detecting and monitoring the Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller. This is provided by leveraging the built-in Prometheus metrics included with Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller [version 0.16.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/Changelog.md#0160) onward.

NOTE:
NGINX Ingress versions prior to 0.16.0 offer an included [VTS Prometheus metrics exporter](nginx_ingress_vts.md), which exports metrics different than the built-in metrics.

## Requirements

[Prometheus integration](../prometheus.md) must be active.

## Metrics supported

| Name | Query |
| ---- | ----- |
| Throughput (req/sec) | `sum(label_replace(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_requests{namespace="%{kube_namespace}",ingress=~".*%{ci_environment_slug}.*"}[2m]), "status_code", "${1}xx", "status", "(.)..")) by (status_code)` |
| Latency (ms) | `sum(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_ingress_upstream_latency_seconds_sum{namespace="%{kube_namespace}",ingress=~".*%{ci_environment_slug}.*"}[2m])) / sum(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_ingress_upstream_latency_seconds_count{namespace="%{kube_namespace}",ingress=~".*%{ci_environment_slug}.*"}[2m])) * 1000` |
| HTTP Error Rate (%) | `sum(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_requests{status=~"5.*",namespace="%{kube_namespace}",ingress=~".*%{ci_environment_slug}.*"}[2m])) / sum(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_requests{namespace="%{kube_namespace}",ingress=~".*%{ci_environment_slug}.*"}[2m])) * 100` |

## Configuring NGINX Ingress monitoring

Version 0.9.0 and above of [NGINX Ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) have built-in support for exporting Prometheus metrics. To enable, a ConfigMap setting must be passed: `enable-vts-status: "true"`. Once enabled, a Prometheus metrics endpoint starts running on port 10254.

Next, the Ingress needs to be annotated for Prometheus monitoring. Two new annotations need to be added:

- `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`
- `prometheus.io/port: "10254"`

Managing these settings depends on how NGINX Ingress has been deployed. If you have deployed via the [official Helm chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress), metrics can be enabled with `controller.stats.enabled` along with the required annotations. Alternatively it is possible to edit the NGINX Ingress YML directly in the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard).

## Specifying the Environment label

To isolate and display only relevant metrics for a given environment, GitLab needs a method to
detect which labels are associated. To do this, GitLab searches for metrics with appropriate labels.
In this case, the `ingress` label must include the value `<CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG>`.

If you have used [Auto Deploy](../../../../topics/autodevops/stages.md#auto-deploy) to deploy your app, this format is used automatically and metrics are detected with no action on your part.
