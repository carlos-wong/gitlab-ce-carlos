# Discord Notifications service **(FREE)**

The Discord Notifications service sends event notifications from GitLab to the channel for which the webhook was created.

To send GitLab event notifications to a Discord channel, [create a webhook in Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
and configure it in GitLab.

## Create webhook

1. Open the Discord channel you want to receive GitLab event notifications.
1. From the channel menu, select **Edit channel**.
1. Select **Integrations**.
1. If there are no existing webhooks, select **Create Webhook**. Otherwise, select **View Webhooks** then **New Webhook**.
1. Enter the name of the bot to post the message.
1. Optional. Edit the avatar.
1. Copy the URL from the **WEBHOOK URL** field.
1. Select **Save**.

## Configure created webhook in GitLab

With the webhook URL created in the Discord channel, you can set up the Discord Notifications service in GitLab.

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Discord Notifications**.
1. Ensure that the **Active** toggle is enabled.
1. Check the checkboxes corresponding to the GitLab events for which you want to send notifications to Discord.
1. Paste the webhook URL that you copied from the create Discord webhook step.
1. Configure the remaining options and click the **Save changes** button.

The Discord channel you created the webhook for now receives notification of the GitLab events that were configured.
