# GitLab quick actions

Quick actions are textual shortcuts for common actions on issues, epics, merge requests,
and commits that are usually done by clicking buttons or dropdowns in GitLab's UI.
You can enter these commands while creating a new issue or merge request, or
in comments of issues, epics, merge requests, and commits. Each command should be
on a separate line in order to be properly detected and executed. Once executed,
the commands are removed from the text body and not visible to anyone else.

## Quick actions for issues and merge requests

The following quick actions are applicable to both issues and merge requests threads,
discussions, and descriptions:
