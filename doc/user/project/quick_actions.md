# GitLab Quick Actions

Quick actions are textual shortcuts for common actions on issues, epics, merge requests,
and commits that are usually done by clicking buttons or dropdowns in GitLab's UI.
You can enter these commands while creating a new issue or merge request, or
in comments of issues, epics, merge requests, and commits. Each command should be
on a separate line in order to be properly detected and executed.

> From [GitLab 12.1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/merge_requests/26672), once an action is executed, an alert is displayed when a quick action is successfully applied.

## Autocomplete characters

Many quick actions require a parameter, for example: username, milestone, and
label. [Autocomplete characters](autocomplete_characters.md) can make it easier
to enter a parameter, compared to selecting items from a list.

## Quick actions parameters

The easiest way to set parameters for quick actions is to use autocomplete. If
you manually enter a parameter, it must be enclosed in double quotation marks
(`"`), unless it contains only:

1. ASCII letters.
1. Numerals.
1. Underscore, hyphen, question mark, dot, and ampersand.

Parameters are also case-sensitive. Autocomplete handles this, and the insertion
of quotation marks, automatically.

## Quick actions for commit messages

The following quick actions are applicable for commit messages:

| Command                 | Action                                    |
|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| `/tag v1.2.3 <message>` | Tags this commit with an optional message |

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
