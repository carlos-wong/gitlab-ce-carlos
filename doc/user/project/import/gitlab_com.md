# Project importing from GitLab.com to your private GitLab instance

You can import your existing GitLab.com projects to your GitLab instance. But keep in mind that it is possible only if
GitLab.com integration is enabled on your GitLab instance.
[Read more about GitLab.com integration for self-managed GitLab instances](../../../integration/gitlab.md).

To get to the importer page you need to go to "New project" page.

>**Note:**
If you are interested in importing Wiki and Merge Request data to your new
instance, you'll need to follow the instructions for [project export](../settings/import_export.md)

To import a project, you can simple click "Import". The importer will import your repository and issues.
Once the importer is done, a new GitLab project will be created with your imported data.
