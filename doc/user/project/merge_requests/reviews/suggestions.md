# Suggest changes **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25381) custom commit messages for suggestions in GitLab 13.9 [with a flag](../../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `suggestions_custom_commit`. Disabled by default.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297404) in GitLab 13.10.

As a reviewer, you're able to suggest code changes with a Markdown syntax in merge request
diff threads. Then, the merge request author (or other users with appropriate
[permission](../../../permissions.md)) can apply these suggestions with a click.
This action generates a commit in the merge request, authored by the user that suggested the changes.

1. Choose a line of code to be changed, add a new comment, then select
   the **Insert suggestion** icon in the toolbar:

   ![Add a new comment](img/suggestion_button_v13_9.png)

1. In the comment, add your suggestion to the pre-populated code block:

   ![Add a suggestion into a code block tagged properly](img/make_suggestion_v13_9.png)

1. Select either **Start a review** or **Add to review** to add your comment to a
   [review](index.md), or **Add comment now** to add the comment to the thread immediately.

   The suggestion in the comment can be applied by the merge request author
   directly from the merge request:

   ![Apply suggestions](img/apply_suggestion_v13_9.png)

1. Optionally specify a custom commit message for individual suggestions (GitLab 13.9 and later) to
   describe your change. If you don't specify it, the default commit message is used.

   ![Custom commit](img/custom_commit_v13_9.png)

After the author applies a suggestion:

1. The suggestion is marked as **Applied**.
1. The thread is resolved.
1. GitLab creates a new commit with the changes.
1. If the user has the Developer role, GitLab pushes
   the suggested change directly into the codebase in the merge request's branch.

## Multi-line suggestions

Reviewers can also suggest changes to multiple lines with a single suggestion
within merge request diff threads by adjusting the range offsets. The
offsets are relative to the position of the diff thread, and specify the
range to be replaced by the suggestion when it is applied.

![Multi-line suggestion syntax](img/multi-line-suggestion-syntax.png)

In the previous example, the suggestion covers three lines above and four lines
below the commented line. When applied, it would replace from 3 lines _above_
to 4 lines _below_ the commented line, with the suggested change.

![Multi-line suggestion preview](img/multi-line-suggestion-preview.png)

NOTE:
Suggestions for multiple lines are limited to 100 lines _above_ and 100
lines _below_ the commented diff line. This allows for up to 200 changed lines per
suggestion.

## Code block nested in suggestions

To add a suggestion that includes a
[fenced code block](../../../markdown.md#code-spans-and-blocks), wrap your suggestion
in four backticks instead of three:

![A comment editor with a suggestion with a fenced code block](img/suggestion_code_block_editor_v12_8.png)

![Output of a comment with a suggestion with a fenced code block](img/suggestion_code_block_output_v12_8.png)

## Configure the commit message for applied suggestions

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13086) in GitLab 12.7.

GitLab uses a default commit message
when applying suggestions: `Apply %{suggestions_count} suggestion(s) to %{files_count} file(s)`

<!-- vale gitlab.BadPlurals = NO -->

For example, consider that a user applied 3 suggestions to 2 different files, the
default commit message is: **Apply 3 suggestion(s) to 2 file(s)**

<!-- vale gitlab.BadPlurals = YES -->

These commit messages can be customized to follow any guidelines you might have.
To do so, expand the **Merge requests** tab within your project's **General**
settings and change the **Merge suggestions** text:

![Custom commit message for applied suggestions](img/suggestions_custom_commit_messages_v14_7.png)

You can also use following variables besides static text:

| Variable               | Description | Output example |
|------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `%{branch_name}`       | The name of the branch to which suggestions were applied. | `my-feature-branch` |
| `%{files_count}`       | The number of files to which suggestions were applied.| **2** |
| `%{file_paths}`        | The paths of the file to which suggestions were applied. Paths are separated by commas.| `docs/index.md, docs/about.md` |
| `%{project_path}`      | The project path. | `my-group/my-project` |
| `%{project_name}`      | The human-readable name of the project. | **My Project** |
| `%{suggestions_count}` | The number of suggestions applied.| **3** |
| `%{username}`          | The username of the user applying suggestions. | `user_1` |
| `%{user_full_name}`    | The full name of the user applying suggestions. | **User 1** |

For example, to customize the commit message to output
**Addresses user_1's review**, set the custom text to
`Addresses %{username}'s review`.

For merge requests created from forks, GitLab uses the template defined in target project.

NOTE:
Custom commit messages for each applied suggestion is
introduced by [#25381](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25381).

## Batch suggestions

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25486) in GitLab 13.1 as an [alpha feature](../../../../policy/alpha-beta-support.md#alpha-features) with a flag named `batch_suggestions`, disabled by default.
> - [Enabled by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/227799) in GitLab 13.2.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320755) in GitLab 13.11. [Feature flag `batch_suggestions`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320755) removed.
> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326168) custom commit messages for batch suggestions in GitLab 14.4.

You can apply multiple suggestions at once to reduce the number of commits added
to your branch to address your reviewers' requests.

1. To start a batch of suggestions to apply with a single commit, select **Add suggestion to batch**:

   ![A code change suggestion displayed, with the add-suggestion option highlighted.](img/add_first_suggestion_to_batch_v13_1.jpg "Add a suggestion to a batch")

1. Add as many additional suggestions to the batch as you wish:

   ![A code change suggestion displayed, with the add-more suggestion option highlighted.](img/add_another_suggestion_to_batch_v13_1.jpg "Add another suggestion to a batch")

1. To remove suggestions, select **Remove from batch**:

   ![A code change suggestion displayed, with the option to remove that suggestion from its batch highlighted.](img/remove_suggestion_from_batch_v13_1.jpg "Remove a suggestion from a batch")

1. Having added all the suggestions to your liking, when ready, select **Apply suggestions**. You
   can optionally specify a custom commit message for [batch suggestions](#batch-suggestions)
   (GitLab 14.4 and later) to describe your change. If you don't specify it, the default commit
   message is used.

   ![A code change suggestion displayed, with the option to apply the batch of suggestions highlighted.](img/apply_batch_of_suggestions_v13_1.jpg "Apply a batch of suggestions")

WARNING:
Suggestions applied from multiple authors creates a commit authored by the user applying the suggestions.
