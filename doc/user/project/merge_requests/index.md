# Merge requests **(FREE)**

Merge requests (MRs) are the way you check source code changes into a branch.
When you open a merge request, you can visualize and collaborate on the code changes before merge.
Merge requests include:

- A description of the request.
- Code changes and inline code reviews.
- Information about CI/CD pipelines.
- A comment section for discussion threads.
- The list of commits.

Read more about [how to get started](getting_started.md).

## View merge requests

You can view merge requests for your project, group, or yourself.

### View merge requests for a project

To view all merge requests for a project:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Merge requests**.

Or, to use a [keyboard shortcut](../../shortcuts.md), press <kbd>g</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>.

### View merge requests for all projects in a group

To view merge requests for all projects in a group:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Groups** and find your group.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Merge requests**.

If your group contains subgroups, this view also displays merge requests from the subgroup projects.

## View all merge requests assigned to you

To view all merge requests assigned to you:

1. On the top bar, put your cursor in the **Search** box.
1. From the dropdown list, select **Merge requests assigned to me**.

Or, to use a [keyboard shortcut](../../shortcuts.md), press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>.

You can [search and filter](../../search/index.md#filter-issue-and-merge-request-lists),
the results, or select a merge request to begin a review.

## Add changes to a merge request

If you have permission to add changes to a merge request, you can add your changes
to an existing merge request in several ways, depending on the complexity of your
change and whether you need access to a development environment:

- [Edit changes in the Web IDE](../web_ide/index.md) in your browser with the
  <kbd>.</kbd> [keyboard shortcut](../../shortcuts.md). Use this
  browser-based method to edit multiple files, or if you are not comfortable with Git commands.
  You cannot run tests from the Web IDE.
- [Edit changes in Gitpod](../../../integration/gitpod.md#launch-gitpod-in-gitlab), if you
  need a fully-featured environment to both edit files, and run tests afterward. Gitpod
  supports running the [GitLab Development Kit (GDK)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit).
  To use Gitpod, you must [enable Gitpod in your user account](../../../integration/gitpod.md#enable-gitpod-in-your-user-settings).
- [Push changes from the command line](../../../gitlab-basics/start-using-git.md), if you are
  familiar with Git and the command line.

## Request attention to a merge request

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343528) in GitLab 14.10 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `mr_attention_requests`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available, ask an administrator to [enable the feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `mr_attention_requests`.
On GitLab.com, this feature is dependent on the enablement status of the feature flag. Refer to the [enablement issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343528) for details.

To tell a merge request's assignee or reviewer that their attention is
needed on a merge request, you can request their attention. If an assignee or a
reviewer has their attention requested on a merge request, the **Attention request**
icon (**{attention}**) is displayed as a solid icon (**{attention-solid}**) on
the merge request list page:

![Attention request icon](img/attention_request_list_v14_10.png)

To view a list of merge requests that need your attention:

1. On the top bar, select **Merge requests** (**{merge-request}**).
1. Select **Attention requests**.

To request attention from another user, use the `/attention @user`
[quick action](../quick_actions.md) or:

1. Go to the merge request.
1. On the right sidebar, identify the user you want to request attention from.
1. Next to the user's name, select **Request attention** (**{attention}**), and the appearance
   of the icon changes:

   ![Attention request toggle](img/attention_request_sidebar_v14_10.png)

### Remove an attention request

If your attention was requested as an assignee or reviewer, it's removed when you:

- Manually remove the attention request by selecting **Remove attention request** (**{attention-solid}**).
- Approve the merge request.
- Add a new user as an assignee or reviewer.
- Request the attention of a different assignee or reviewer.
- Remove yourself (or are removed by someone else) as an assignee or reviewer.
- Merge or close the merge request.

If you are both the assignee and a reviewer on a merge request, you receive
only one attention request, which is synced across both duties. If the
attention request is removed from you, either as an assignee or a reviewer,
it is removed from both your duties.

## Close a merge request

If you decide to permanently stop work on a merge request,
GitLab recommends you close the merge request rather than
[delete it](#delete-a-merge-request). The author and assignees of a merge request, and users with
Developer, Maintainer, or Owner [roles](../../permissions.md) in a project
can close merge requests in the project:

1. Go to the merge request you want to close.
1. Scroll to the comment box at the bottom of the page.
1. Following the comment box, select **Close merge request**.

GitLab closes the merge request, but preserves records of the merge request,
its comments, and any associated pipelines.

### Delete a merge request

GitLab recommends you close, rather than delete, merge requests.

WARNING:
You cannot undo the deletion of a merge request.

To delete a merge request:

1. Sign in to GitLab as a user with the project Owner role.
   Only users with this role can delete merge requests in a project.
1. Go to the merge request you want to delete, and select **Edit**.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and select **Delete merge request**.

## Merge request workflows

For a software developer working in a team:

1. You checkout a new branch, and submit your changes through a merge request.
1. You gather feedback from your team.
1. You work on the implementation optimizing code with [Code Quality reports](code_quality.md).
1. You verify your changes with [Unit test reports](../../../ci/unit_test_reports.md) in GitLab CI/CD.
1. You avoid using dependencies whose license is not compatible with your project with [License Compliance reports](../../compliance/license_compliance/index.md).
1. You request the [approval](approvals/index.md) from your manager.
1. Your manager:
   1. Pushes a commit with their final review.
   1. [Approves the merge request](approvals/index.md).
   1. Sets it to [merge when pipeline succeeds](merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.md).
1. Your changes get deployed to production with [manual jobs](../../../ci/jobs/job_control.md#create-a-job-that-must-be-run-manually) for GitLab CI/CD.
1. Your implementations were successfully shipped to your customer.

For a web developer writing a webpage for your company's website:

1. You checkout a new branch and submit a new page through a merge request.
1. You gather feedback from your reviewers.
1. You preview your changes with [Review Apps](../../../ci/review_apps/index.md).
1. You request your web designers for their implementation.
1. You request the [approval](approvals/index.md) from your manager.
1. Once approved, your merge request is [squashed and merged](squash_and_merge.md), and [deployed to staging with GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/05/ci-deployment-and-environments/).
1. Your production team [cherry-picks](cherry_pick_changes.md) the merge commit into production.
