# GitLab Pages **(FREE)**

With GitLab Pages, you can publish static websites directly from a repository
in GitLab.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-9">
<p style="margin-top: 18px;">
<ul>
<li>Use for any personal or business website.</li>
<li>Use any Static Site Generator (SSG) or plain HTML.</li>
<li>Create websites for your projects, groups, or user account.</li>
<li>Host your site on your own GitLab instance or on GitLab.com for free.</li>
<li>Connect your custom domains and TLS certificates.</li>
<li>Attribute any license to your content.</li>
</ul>
</p>

To publish a website with Pages, you can use any static site generator,
like Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Middleman, Harp, Hexo, or Brunch. You can also
publish any website written directly in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Pages does not support dynamic server-side processing, for instance, as `.php` and `.asp` requires.

## How it works

To use GitLab Pages, you must create a project in GitLab to upload your website's
files to. These projects can be either public, internal, or private.

GitLab always deploys your website from a specific folder called `public` in your
repository. When you create a new project in GitLab, a [repository](../repository/index.md)
becomes available automatically.

To deploy your site, GitLab uses its built-in tool called [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md)
to build your site and publish it to the GitLab Pages server. The sequence of
scripts that GitLab CI/CD runs to accomplish this task is created from a file named
`.gitlab-ci.yml`, which you can [create and modify](getting_started/pages_from_scratch.md).
A specific `job` called `pages` in the configuration file makes GitLab aware that you're deploying a
GitLab Pages website.

You can either use the GitLab [default domain for GitLab Pages websites](getting_started_part_one.md#gitlab-pages-default-domain-names),
`*.gitlab.io`, or your own domain (`example.com`). In that case, you
must be an administrator in your domain's registrar (or control panel) to set it up with Pages.

The following diagrams show the workflows you might follow to get started with Pages.

## Access to your Pages site

If you're using GitLab Pages default domain (`.gitlab.io`), your website is
automatically secure and available under HTTPS. If you're using your own custom
domain, you can optionally secure it with SSL/TLS certificates.

If you're using GitLab.com, your website is publicly available to the internet.
To restrict access to your website, enable [GitLab Pages Access Control](pages_access_control.md).

If you're using a self-managed instance, your websites are published on your
own server, according to the [Pages settings](../../../administration/pages/index.md)
chosen by your sysadmin, who can make them public or internal.

## Administer GitLab Pages for self-managed instances

If you are running a self-managed instance of GitLab,
[follow the administration steps](../../../administration/pages/index.md) to configure Pages.

## Security for GitLab Pages

If your username is `example`, your GitLab Pages website is located at `example.gitlab.io`.
GitLab allows usernames to contain a `.`, so a user named `bar.example` could create
a GitLab Pages website `bar.example.gitlab.io` that effectively is a subdomain of your
`example.gitlab.io` website. Be careful if you use JavaScript to set cookies for your website.
The safe way to manually set cookies with JavaScript is to not specify the `domain` at all:

```javascript
// Safe: This cookie is only visible to example.gitlab.io
document.cookie = "key=value";

// Unsafe: This cookie is visible to example.gitlab.io and its subdomains,
// regardless of the presence of the leading dot.
document.cookie = "key=value;domain=.example.gitlab.io";
document.cookie = "key=value;domain=example.gitlab.io";
```

This issue doesn't affect users with a custom domain, or users who don't set any
cookies manually with JavaScript.
