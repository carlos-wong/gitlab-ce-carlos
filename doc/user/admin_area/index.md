# GitLab Admin Area **(FREE SELF)**

The Admin Area provides a web UI to manage and configure some features of GitLab
self-managed instances. If you are an administrator, you can access the Admin Area
by visiting `/admin` on your self-managed instance. You can also access it through
the UI:

- GitLab versions 14.0 and later: on the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
- GitLab versions 13.12 and earlier: on the top bar, select the Admin Area icon (**{admin}**).

NOTE:
Only administrators can access the Admin Area.

## Overview section

The following topics document the **Overview** section of the Admin Area.

### Administering Projects

You can administer all projects in the GitLab instance from the Admin Area's Projects page.

To access the Projects page:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Projects**.
1. Select the **All**, **Private**, **Internal**, or **Public** tab to list only
   projects of that criteria.

By default, all projects are listed, in reverse order of when they were last updated. For each
project, the following information is listed:

- Name
- Namespace
- Description
- Size, updated every 15 minutes at most

Projects can be edited or deleted.

The list of projects can be sorted by:

- Updated date
- Last created
- Name
- Most stars
- Oldest created
- Oldest updated
- Largest repository

A user can choose to hide or show archived projects in the list.

In the **Filter by name** field, type the project name you want to find, and GitLab filters
them as you type.

To filter only projects in that namespace, select from the **Namespace** dropdown list.

You can combine the filter options. For example, to list only public projects with `score` in their name:

1. Click the **Public** tab.
1. Enter `score` in the **Filter by name...** input box.

### Administering Users

You can administer all users in the GitLab instance from the Admin Area's Users page:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Users**.

To list users matching a specific criteria, click on one of the following tabs on the **Users** page:

- **Active**
- **Admins**
- **2FA Enabled**
- **2FA Disabled**
- **External**
- **[Blocked](moderate_users.md#block-a-user)**
- **[Deactivated](moderate_users.md#deactivate-a-user)**
- **Without projects**

For each user, the following are listed:

1. Username
1. Email address
1. Project membership count
1. Group membership count ([introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276215) in GitLab 13.12)
1. Date of account creation
1. Date of last activity

To edit a user, click the **Edit** button in that user's
row. To delete the user, or delete the user and their contributions, click the cog dropdown in
that user's row, and select the desired option.

To change the sort order:

1. Click the sort dropdown.
1. Select the desired order.

By default the sort dropdown shows **Name**.

To search for users, enter your criteria in the search field. The user search is case
insensitive, and applies partial matching to name and username. To search for an email address,
you must provide the complete email address.

#### User impersonation

An administrator can "impersonate" any other user, including other administrators.
This allows the administrator to "see what the user sees," and take actions on behalf of the user.
You can impersonate a user in the following ways:

- Through the UI:
  1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Users**.
  1. From the list of users, select a user.
  1. Select **Impersonate**.
- With the API, using [impersonation tokens](../../api/index.md#impersonation-tokens).

All impersonation activities are [captured with audit events](../../administration/audit_events.md#impersonation-data).

By default, impersonation is enabled. GitLab can be configured to [disable impersonation](../../api/index.md#disable-impersonation).

![user impersonation button](img/impersonate_user_button_v13_8.png)

#### User Permission Export **(PREMIUM SELF)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1772) in GitLab 13.8.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292436) in GitLab 13.9.

An administrator can export user permissions for all users in the GitLab instance from the Admin Area's Users page.
The export lists direct membership the users have in groups and projects.

The following data is included in the export:

- Username
- Email
- Type
- Path
- Access level ([Project](../permissions.md#project-members-permissions) and [Group](../permissions.md#group-members-permissions))
- Date of last activity ([introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345388) in GitLab 14.6). For a list of activities that populate this column, see the [Users API documentation](../../api/users.md#get-user-activities-admin-only).

Only the first 100,000 user accounts are exported.

![user permission export button](img/export_permissions_v13_11.png)

#### Users statistics

The **Users statistics** page provides an overview of user accounts by role. These statistics are
calculated daily, so user changes made since the last update are not reflected.

The following totals are also included:

- Billable users
- Blocked users
- Total users

GitLab billing is based on the number of [**Billable users**](../../subscriptions/self_managed/index.md#billable-users).

#### Add email to user

You must be an administrator to manually add emails to users:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Users** (`/admin/users`).
1. Locate the user and select them.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. In **Email**, enter the new email address. This adds the new email address to the
   user and sets the previous email address to be a secondary.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### User cohorts

The [Cohorts](user_cohorts.md) tab displays the monthly cohorts of new users and their activities over time.

You can administer all groups in the GitLab instance from the Admin Area's Groups page.

To access the Groups page:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Groups**.

For each group, the page displays their name, description, size, number of projects in the group,
number of members, and whether the group is private, internal, or public. To edit a group, click
the **Edit** button in that group's row. To delete the group, click the **Delete** button in
that group's row.

To change the sort order, click the sort dropdown and select the desired order. The default
sort order is by **Last created**.

To search for groups by name, enter your criteria in the search field. The group search is case
insensitive, and applies partial matching.

To [Create a new group](../group/index.md#create-a-group) click **New group**.

### Administering Topics

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340920) in GitLab 14.4.

  - Number of connections
  - Current memory usage, measured in MB
  - Peak memory usage, measured in MB

### Logs

Since GitLab 13.0, **Log** view has been removed from the Admin Area dashboard since the logging does not work in multi-node setups and could cause confusion for administrators by displaying partial information.

For multi-node systems we recommend ingesting the logs into services like Elasticsearch and Splunk.

| Log file                | Contents |
|:------------------------|:---------|
| `application.log`       | GitLab user activity |
| `git_json.log`          | Failed GitLab interaction with Git repositories |
| `production.log`        | Requests received from Puma, and the actions taken to serve those requests |
| `sidekiq.log`           | Background jobs |
| `repocheck.log`         | Repository activity |
| `integrations_json.log` | Activity between GitLab and integrated systems |
| `kubernetes.log`        | Kubernetes activity |

The contents of these log files can be useful when troubleshooting a problem.

For details of these log files and their contents, see [Log system](../../administration/logs.md).

The content of each log file is listed in chronological order. To minimize performance issues, a maximum 2000 lines of each log file are shown.

### Requests Profiles

The **Requests Profiles** page contains the token required for profiling. For more details, see [Request Profiling](../../administration/monitoring/performance/request_profiling.md).

### Audit Events **(PREMIUM SELF)**

The **Audit Events** page lists changes made within the GitLab server. With this information you can control, analyze, and track every change.
