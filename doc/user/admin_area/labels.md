# Labels administration **[CORE ONLY]**

In the Admin Area, you can manage labels for the GitLab instance. For more details, see [Labels](../project/labels.md).

## Default Labels

Labels created in the Admin Area become available to each _new_ project.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
