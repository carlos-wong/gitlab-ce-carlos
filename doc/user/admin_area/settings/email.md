# Email

You can customize some of the content in emails sent from your GitLab instance.

## Custom logo

The logo in the header of some emails can be customized, see the [logo customization section](../../../customization/branded_page_and_email_header.md).

## Custom additional text **[PREMIUM ONLY]**

> [Introduced][ee-5031] in [GitLab Premium][eep] 10.7.

The additional text will appear at the bottom of any email and can be used for
legal/auditing/compliance reasons.

1. Go to **Admin area > Settings** (`/admin/application_settings`).
1. Under the **Email** section, change the **Additional text** field.
1. Hit **Save** for the changes to take effect.

## Custom hostname for private commit emails

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/22560) in GitLab 11.5.

This configuration option sets the email hostname for [private commit emails](../../profile/index.md#private-commit-email).
 By default it is set to `users.noreply.YOUR_CONFIGURED_HOSTNAME`.

In order to change this option:

1. Go to **Admin area > Settings** (`/admin/application_settings`).
1. Under the **Email** section, change the **Custom hostname (for private commit emails)** field.
1. Hit **Save** for the changes to take effect.

NOTE: **Note**: Once the hostname gets configured, every private commit email using the previous hostname, will not get
recognized by GitLab. This can directly conflict with certain [Push rules](../../../push_rules/push_rules.md) such as
`Check whether author is a GitLab user` and `Check whether committer is the current authenticated user`.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
