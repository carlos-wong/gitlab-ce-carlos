# Gitaly timeouts **(FREE SELF)**

[Gitaly](../../../administration/gitaly/index.md) timeouts are configurable. The timeouts can be
configured to make sure that long-running Gitaly calls don't needlessly take up resources.

To access Gitaly timeout settings:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Preferences**.
1. Expand the **Gitaly timeouts** section.

## Available timeouts

The following timeouts are available.

| Timeout | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:--------|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default | 55 seconds | Timeout for most Gitaly calls (not enforced for `git` `fetch` and `push` operations, or Sidekiq jobs). For example, checking if a repository exists on disk. Makes sure that Gitaly calls made within a web request cannot exceed the entire request timeout. It should be shorter than the [worker timeout](../../../administration/operations/puma.md#change-the-worker-timeout) that can be configured for [Puma](../../../install/requirements.md#puma-settings). If a Gitaly call timeout exceeds the worker timeout, the remaining time from the worker timeout is used to avoid having to terminate the worker. |
| Fast    | 10 seconds | Timeout for fast Gitaly operations used within requests, sometimes multiple times. For example, checking if a repository exists on disk. If fast operations exceed this threshold, there may be a problem with a storage shard. Failing fast can help maintain the stability of the GitLab instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Medium  | 30 seconds | Timeout for Gitaly operations that should be fast (possibly within requests) but preferably not used multiple times within a request. For example, loading blobs. Timeout that should be set between Default and Fast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
