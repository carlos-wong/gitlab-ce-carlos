Within GitLab, we inform users of available third-party offers they might find valuable in order to enhance the development of their projects.  
An example is the Google Cloud Platform free credit for using [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

The display of third-party offers can be toggled in the Admin area on the Settings page.
