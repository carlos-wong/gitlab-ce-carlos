# Search through GitLab

## Issues and merge requests

To search through issues and merge requests in multiple projects, you can use the **Issues** or **Merge Requests** links
in the top-right part of your screen.

Both of them work in the same way, therefore, the following notes are valid for both.

The number displayed on their right represents the number of issues and merge requests assigned to you.

![issues and MRs dashboard links](img/dashboard_links.png)

When you click **Issues**, you'll see the opened issues assigned to you straight away:

![Issues assigned to you](img/issues_assigned_to_you.png)

You can search through **Open**, **Closed**, or **All** issues.

You can also filter the results using the search and filter field. This works in the same way as the ones found in the
per project pages described below.

### Issues and MRs assigned to you or created by you

You'll also find shortcuts to issues and merge requests created by you or assigned to you
on the search field on the top-right of your screen:

![shortcut to your issues and mrs](img/issues_mrs_shortcut.png)

### Issues and merge requests per project

If you want to search for issues present in a specific project, navigate to
a project's **Issues** tab, and click on the field **Search or filter results...**. It will
display a dropdown menu, from which you can add filters per author, assignee, milestone,
label, weight, and 'my-reaction' (based on your emoji votes). When done, press **Enter** on your keyboard to filter the issues.

![filter issues in a project](img/issue_search_filter.png)

The same process is valid for merge requests. Navigate to your project's **Merge Requests** tab,
and click **Search or filter results...**. Merge requests can be filtered by author, assignee,
milestone, and label.

### Filtering by **None** / **Any**

Some filter fields like milestone and assignee, allow you to filter by **None** or **Any**.

![filter by none any](img/issues_filter_none_any.png)

Selecting **None** returns results that have an empty value for that field. E.g.: no milestone, no assignee.

Selecting **Any** does the opposite. It returns results that have a non-empty value for that field.

### Searching for specific terms

You can filter issues and merge requests by specific terms included in titles or descriptions.

- Syntax
    - Searches look for all the words in a query, in any order. E.g.: searching
      issues for `display bug` will return all issues matching both those words, in any order.
    - To find the exact term, use double quotes: `"display bug"`
- Limitation
    - For performance reasons, terms shorter than 3 chars are ignored. E.g.: searching
      issues for `included in titles` is same as `included titles`

### Issues and merge requests per group

Similar to **Issues and merge requests per project**, you can also search for issues
within a group. Navigate to a group's **Issues** tab and query search results in
the same way as you do for projects.

![filter issues in a group](img/group_issues_filter.png)

The same process is valid for merge requests. Navigate to your project's **Merge Requests** tab.

## Search history

You can view recent searches by clicking on the little arrow-clock icon, which is to the left of the search input. Click the search entry to run that search again. This feature is available for issues and merge requests. Searches are stored locally in your browser.

## Removing search filters

Individual filters can be removed by clicking on the filter's (x) button or backspacing. The entire search filter can be cleared by clicking on the search box's (x) button.

## Filtering with multiple filters of the same type

Some filters can be added multiple times. These include but are not limited to assignees and labels. When you filter with these multiple filters of the same type, the AND logic is applied. For example, if you were filtering `assignee:@sam assignee:@sarah`, your results will only include entries whereby the assignees are assigned to both Sam and Sarah are returned.

### Shortcut

You'll also find a shortcut on the search field on the top-right of the project's dashboard to
quickly access issues and merge requests created or assigned to you within that project:

![search per project - shortcut](img/project_search.png)

## Todos

Your [todos](../../workflow/todos.md#gitlab-todos) can be searched by "to do" and "done".
You can [filter](../../workflow/todos.md#filtering-your-todos) them per project,
author, type, and action. Also, you can sort them by
[**Label priority**](../../user/project/labels.md#label-priority),
**Last created** and **Oldest created**.

## Projects

You can search through your projects from the left menu, by clicking the menu bar, then **Projects**.
On the field **Filter by name**, type the project or group name you want to find, and GitLab
will filter them for you as you type.

You can also look for the projects you starred (**Starred projects**), and **Explore** all
public and internal projects available in GitLab.com, from which you can filter by visibility,
through **Trending**, best rated with **Most starts**, or **All** of them.

You can also sort them by **Name**, **Last created**, **Oldest created**, **Last updated**,
**Oldest updated**, **Owner**, and choose to hide or show **archived projects**:

![sort projects](img/sort_projects.png)

## Groups

Similarly to [projects search](#projects), you can search through your groups from
the left menu, by clicking the menu bar, then **Groups**.

On the field **Filter by name**, type the group name you want to find, and GitLab
will filter them for you as you type.

You can also **Explore** all public and internal groups available in GitLab.com,
and sort them by **Last created**, **Oldest created**, **Last updated**, or **Oldest updated**.

## Issue Boards

From an [Issue Board](../../user/project/issue_board.md), you can filter issues by **Author**, **Assignee**, **Milestone**, and **Labels**.
You can also filter them by name (issue title), from the field **Filter by name**, which is loaded as you type.

When you want to search for issues to add to lists present in your Issue Board, click
the button **Add issues** on the top-right of your screen, opening a modal window from which
you'll be able to, besides filtering them by **Name**, **Author**, **Assignee**, **Milestone**,
and **Labels**, select multiple issues to add to a list of your choice:
