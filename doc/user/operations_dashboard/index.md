# Operations Dashboard **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/5781) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 11.5. [Moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/9218) to [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) in 11.10.

The Operations Dashboard provides a summary of each project's operational health,
including pipeline and alert status.

The dashboard can be accessed via the top bar, by clicking on the new
dashboard icon:

## Adding a project to the dashboard

NOTE: **Note:**
For GitLab.com, you can add your project to the Operations Dashboard for free if
your project is public. If your project is private, the group it belongs to must
have a [Silver](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) plan.

To add a project to the dashboard:

1. Click the **Add projects** button in the homescreen of the dashboard.
1. Search and add one or more projects using the **Search your projects** field.
1. Click the **Add projects** button.

Once added, the dashboard will display the project's number of active alerts,
last commit, pipeline status, and when it was last deployed.
