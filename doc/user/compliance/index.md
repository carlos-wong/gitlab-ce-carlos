# Compliance **(ULTIMATE)**

The compliance tools provided by GitLab let you keep an eye on various aspects of your project. The
following compliance tools are available:

- [Compliance Dashboard](compliance_dashboard/index.md): View recent merge request activity across
  all projects in a group. This lets you see if merge requests were approved, and by whom.
- [License Compliance](license_compliance/index.md): Search your project's dependencies for their
  licenses. This lets you determine if the licenses of your project's dependencies are compatible
  with your project's license.
