# Permissions and roles **(FREE)**

Users have different abilities depending on the role they have in a
particular group or project. If a user is both in a project's group and the
project itself, the highest role is used.

On [public and internal projects](../api/projects.md#project-visibility-level), the Guest role
(not to be confused with [Guest user](#free-guest-users)) is not enforced.

When a member leaves a team's project, all the assigned [issues](project/issues/index.md) and
[merge requests](project/merge_requests/index.md) are automatically unassigned.

GitLab [administrators](../administration/index.md) receive all permissions.

To add or import a user, you can follow the
[project members documentation](project/members/index.md).

## Principles behind permissions

See our [product handbook on permissions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#permissions-in-gitlab).

## Instance-wide user permissions

By default, users can create top-level groups and change their
usernames. A GitLab administrator can configure the GitLab instance to
[modify this behavior](../administration/user_settings.md).

## Project members permissions

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219299) in GitLab 14.8, personal namespace owners appear with Owner role in new projects in their namespace. Introduced [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `personal_project_owner_with_owner_access`. Disabled by default.
- [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351919) in GitLab 14.9. Feature flag `personal_project_owner_with_owner_access` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219299).

A user's role determines what permissions they have on a project. The Owner role provides all permissions but is
available only:

- For group owners. The role is inherited for a group's projects.
- For Administrators.

Personal [namespace](group/index.md#namespaces) owners:

- Are displayed as having the Maintainer role on projects in the namespace, but have the same permissions as a user with the Owner role.
- In GitLab 14.9 and later, for new projects in the namespace, are displayed as having the Owner role.

For more information about how to manage project members, see
[members of a project](project/members/index.md).

The following table lists project permissions available for each role:

<!-- Keep this table sorted: By topic first, then by minimum role, then alphabetically. -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

1. On self-managed GitLab instances, guest users are able to perform this action only on
   public and internal projects (not on private projects). [External users](#external-users)
   must be given explicit access even if the project is internal. For GitLab.com, see the
   [GitLab.com visibility settings](gitlab_com/index.md#visibility-settings).
2. Guest users can only view the [confidential issues](project/issues/confidential_issues.md) they created themselves or are assigned to.
3. Not allowed for Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, or Owner. See [protected branches](project/protected_branches.md).
4. If the [branch is protected](project/protected_branches.md), this depends on the access Developers and Maintainers are given.
5. Guest users can access GitLab [**Releases**](project/releases/index.md) for downloading assets but are not allowed to download the source code nor see [repository information like commits and release evidence](project/releases/index.md#view-a-release-and-download-assets).
6. Actions are limited only to records owned (referenced) by user.
7. When [Share Group Lock](group/index.md#prevent-a-project-from-being-shared-with-groups) is enabled the project can't be shared with other groups. It does not affect group with group sharing.
8. For information on eligible approvers for merge requests, see
   [Eligible approvers](project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#eligible-approvers).
9. Applies only to comments on [Design Management](project/issues/design_management.md) designs.
10. Users can only view events based on their individual actions.
11. Project access tokens are supported for self-managed instances on Free and above. They are also
    supported on GitLab SaaS Premium and above (excluding [trial licenses](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/)).
12. If the [tag is protected](#release-permissions-with-protected-tags), this depends on the access Developers and Maintainers are given.
13. A Maintainer can't change project features visibility level if
    [project visibility](public_access.md) is set to private.
14. Attached design files are moved together with the issue even if the user doesn't have the
    Developer role.
15. Guest users can only set metadata (for example, labels, assignees, or milestones)
    when creating an issue. They cannot change the metadata on existing issues.
16. In GitLab 14.5 or later, Guests are not allowed to [create incidents](../operations/incident_management/incidents.md#incident-creation).
    In GitLab 15.1 and later, a Guest who created an issue that was promoted to an incident cannot edit, close, or reopen their incident.
17. In projects that accept contributions from external members, users can create, edit, and close their own merge requests.
18. Authors and assignees of issues can modify the title and description even if they don't have the Reporter role.
19. Authors and assignees can close and reopen issues even if they don't have the Reporter role.
20. The ability to view the Container Registry and pull images is controlled by the [Container Registry's visibility permissions](packages/container_registry/index.md#container-registry-visibility-permissions).
21. Maintainers cannot create, demote, or remove Owners, and they cannot promote users to the Owner role. They also cannot approve Owner role access requests.

## Project features permissions

More details about the permissions for some project-level features follow.

### GitLab CI/CD permissions

[GitLab CI/CD](../ci/index.md) permissions for some roles can be modified by these settings:

- [Public pipelines](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#change-which-users-can-view-your-pipelines):
  When set to public, gives access to certain CI/CD features to *Guest* project members.
- [Pipeline visibility](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#change-pipeline-visibility-for-non-project-members-in-public-projects):
  When set to **Everyone with Access**, gives access to certain CI/CD "view" features to *non-project* members.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

1. Groups can be set to allow either Owners, or Owners and users with the Maintainer role, to [create subgroups](group/subgroups/index.md#create-a-subgroup).
2. Introduced in GitLab 12.2.
3. Default project creation role can be changed at:
   - The [instance level](admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#define-which-roles-can-create-projects).
   - The [group level](group/index.md#specify-who-can-add-projects-to-a-group).
4. Does not apply to subgroups.
5. Developers can push commits to the default branch of a new project only if the [default branch protection](group/index.md#change-the-default-branch-protection-of-a-group) is set to "Partially protected" or "Not protected".
6. In addition, if your group is public or internal, all users who can see the group can also see group wiki pages.
7. Users can only view events based on their individual actions.

### Subgroup permissions

When you add a member to a subgroup, they inherit the membership and
permission level from the parent groups. This model allows access to
nested groups if you have membership in one of its parents.

To learn more, read through the documentation on
[subgroups memberships](group/subgroups/index.md#subgroup-membership).

## External users **(FREE SELF)**

In cases where it is desired that a user has access only to some internal or
private projects, there is the option of creating **External Users**. This
feature may be useful when for example a contractor is working on a given
project and should only have access to that project.

External users:

- Can only create projects (including forks), subgroups, and snippets within the top-level group to which they belong.
- Can only access public projects and projects to which they are explicitly granted access,
  thus hiding all other internal or private ones from them (like being
  logged out).
- Can only access public groups and groups to which they are explicitly granted access,
  thus hiding all other internal or private ones from them (like being
  logged out).
- Can only access public snippets.

Access can be granted by adding the user as member to the project or group.
Like usual users, they receive a role in the project or group with all
the abilities that are mentioned in the [permissions table above](#project-members-permissions).
For example, if an external user is added as Guest, and your project is internal or
private, they do not have access to the code; you need to grant the external
user access at the Reporter level or above if you want them to have access to the code. You should
always take into account the
[project's visibility and permissions settings](project/settings/index.md#configure-project-visibility-features-and-permissions)
as well as the permission level of the user.

NOTE:
External users still count towards a license seat.

An administrator can flag a user as external by either of the following methods:

- [Through the API](../api/users.md#user-modification).
- Using the GitLab UI:
  1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Overview > Users** to create a new user or edit an existing one.
     There, you can find the option to flag the user as external.

Additionally, users can be set as external users using:

- [SAML groups](../integration/saml.md#external-groups).
- [LDAP groups](../administration/auth/ldap/ldap_synchronization.md#external-groups).

### Setting new users to external

By default, new users are not set as external users. This behavior can be changed
by an administrator:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Account and limit** section.

If you change the default behavior of creating new users as external, you
have the option to narrow it down by defining a set of internal users.
The **Internal users** field allows specifying an email address regex pattern to
identify default internal users. New users whose email address matches the regex
pattern are set to internal by default rather than an external collaborator.

The regex pattern format is in Ruby, but it needs to be convertible to JavaScript,
and the ignore case flag is set (`/regex pattern/i`). Here are some examples:

- Use `\.internal@domain\.com$` to mark email addresses ending with
  `.internal@domain.com` as internal.
- Use `^(?:(?!\.ext@domain\.com).)*$\r?` to mark users with email addresses
  not including `.ext@domain.com` as internal.

WARNING:
Be aware that this regex could lead to a
[regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).

## Free Guest users **(ULTIMATE)**

When a user is given the Guest role on a project, group, or both, and holds no
higher permission level on any other project or group on the GitLab instance,
the user is considered a guest user by GitLab and does not consume a license seat.
There is no other specific "guest" designation for newly created users.

If the user is assigned a higher role on any projects or groups, the user
takes a license seat. If a user creates a project, the user becomes a Maintainer
on the project, resulting in the use of a license seat. Also, note that if your
project is internal or private, Guest users have all the abilities that are
mentioned in the [permissions table above](#project-members-permissions) (they
are unable to browse the project's repository, for example).

NOTE:
To prevent a guest user from creating projects, as an administrator, you can edit the
user's profile to mark the user as [external](#external-users).
Beware though that even if a user is external, if they already have Reporter or
higher permissions in any project or group, they are **not** counted as a
free guest user.

## Auditor users **(PREMIUM SELF)**

Auditor users are given read-only access to all projects, groups, and other
resources on the GitLab instance.

An Auditor user should be able to access all projects and groups of a GitLab instance
with the permissions described on the documentation on [auditor users permissions](../administration/auditor_users.md#auditor-user-permissions-and-restrictions).

[Read more about Auditor users.](../administration/auditor_users.md)

## Users with minimal access **(PREMIUM)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40942) in GitLab 13.4.

Owners can add members with a "minimal access" role to a parent group. Such users don't automatically have access to
projects and subgroups underneath. Owners must explicitly add these "minimal access" users to the specific subgroups and
projects.

Because of an [outstanding issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267996), when minimal access users:

- Sign in with standard web authentication, they receive a `404` error when accessing the parent group.
- Sign in with Group SSO, they receive a `404` error immediately because they are redirected to the parent group page.

To work around the issue, give these users the Guest role or higher to any project or subgroup within the parent group.

### Minimal access users take license seats

Users with even a "minimal access" role are counted against your number of license seats. This
requirement does not apply for [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
subscriptions.

## Project features

Project features like wiki and issues can be hidden from users depending on
which visibility level you select on project settings.

- Disabled: disabled for everyone.
- Only team members: only team members can see, even if your project is public or internal.
- Everyone with access: everyone can see depending on your project visibility level.
- Everyone: enabled for everyone (only available for GitLab Pages).

## Release permissions with protected tags

[The permission to create tags](project/protected_tags.md) is used to define if a user can
create, edit, and delete [Releases](project/releases/index.md).

See [Release permissions](project/releases/index.md#release-permissions)
for more information.

## LDAP users permissions

LDAP user permissions can be manually overridden by an administrator.
Read through the documentation on [LDAP users permissions](group/index.md#manage-group-memberships-via-ldap) to learn more.

## Project aliases

Project aliases can only be read, created and deleted by a GitLab administrator.
Read through the documentation on [Project aliases](../user/project/import/index.md#project-aliases) to learn more.
