# Permissions

Users have different abilities depending on the access level they have in a
particular group or project. If a user is both in a group's project and the
project itself, the highest permission level is used.

On public and internal projects the Guest role is not enforced. All users will
be able to create issues, leave comments, and clone or download the project code.

When a member leaves a team's project, all the assigned [Issues](project/issues/index.md) and [Merge Requests](project/merge_requests/index.md)
will be unassigned automatically.

GitLab [administrators](../administration/index.md) receive all permissions.

To add or import a user, you can follow the
[project members documentation](project/members/index.md).

For information on eligible approvers for Merge Requests, see
[Eligible approvers](project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.md#eligible-approvers).

## Principles behind permissions

See our [product handbook on permissions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product#permissions-in-gitlab)

## Instance-wide user permissions

By default, users can create top-level groups and change their
usernames. A GitLab administrator can configure the GitLab instance to
[modify this behavior](../administration/user_settings.md).

## Project members permissions

NOTE: **Note:**
In GitLab 11.0, the Master role was renamed to Maintainer.

The following table depicts the various user permission levels in a project.

| Action                                            | Guest   | Reporter   | Developer   |Maintainer| Owner  |

## Project features permissions

### Wiki and issues

Project features like wiki and issues can be hidden from users depending on
which visibility level you select on project settings.

- Disabled: disabled for everyone
- Only team members: only team members will see even if your project is public or internal
- Everyone with access: everyone can see depending on your project visibility level
- Everyone: enabled for everyone (only available for GitLab Pages)

### Protected branches

To prevent people from messing with history or pushing code without
review, we've created protected branches. Read through the documentation on
[protected branches](project/protected_branches.md)
to learn more.

Additionally, you can allow or forbid users with Maintainer and/or
Developer permissions to push to a protected branch. Read through the documentation on
[Allowed to Merge and Allowed to Push settings](project/protected_branches.md#using-the-allowed-to-merge-and-allowed-to-push-settings)
to learn more.

### Cycle Analytics permissions

Find the current permissions on the Cycle Analytics dashboard on
the [documentation on Cycle Analytics permissions](project/cycle_analytics.md#permissions).

### Issue Board permissions

Developers and users with higher permission level can use all
the functionality of the Issue Board, that is create/delete lists
and drag issues around. Read though the
[documentation on Issue Boards permissions](project/issue_board.md#permissions)
to learn more.

### File Locking permissions **[PREMIUM]**

The user that locks a file or directory is the only one that can edit and push their changes back to the repository where the locked objects are located.

Read through the documentation on [permissions for File Locking](project/file_lock.md#permissions-on-file-locking) to learn more.

### Confidential Issues permissions

Confidential issues can be accessed by reporters and higher permission levels,
as well as by guest users that create a confidential issue. To learn more,
read through the documentation on [permissions and access to confidential issues](project/issues/confidential_issues.md#permissions-and-access-to-confidential-issues).

### Releases permissions

[Project Releases](project/releases/index.md) can be read by project
members with Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, and Owner permissions.
Guest users can access Release pages for downloading assets but
are not allowed to download the source code nor see repository
information such as tags and commits.

Releases can be created, updated, or deleted via [Releases APIs](../api/releases/index.md)
by project Developers, Maintainers, and Owners.

## Group members permissions

NOTE: **Note:**
In GitLab 11.0, the Master role was renamed to Maintainer.

Any user can remove themselves from a group, unless they are the last Owner of
the group. The following table depicts the various user permission levels in a
group.

| Action                                          | Guest | Reporter | Developer | Maintainer | Owner |

### Subgroup permissions

When you add a member to a subgroup, they inherit the membership and
permission level from the parent group. This model allows access to
nested groups if you have membership in one of its parents.

To learn more, read through the documentation on
[subgroups memberships](group/subgroups/index.md#membership).

## External users permissions

In cases where it is desired that a user has access only to some internal or
private projects, there is the option of creating **External Users**. This
feature may be useful when for example a contractor is working on a given
project and should only have access to that project.

External users can only access projects to which they are explicitly granted
access, thus hiding all other internal or private ones from them. Access can be
granted by adding the user as member to the project or group.

They will, like usual users, receive a role in the project or group with all
the abilities that are mentioned in the table above. They cannot however create
groups or projects, and they have the same access as logged out users in all
other cases.

An administrator can flag a user as external [through the API](../api/users.md)
or by checking the checkbox on the admin panel. As an administrator, navigate
to **Admin > Users** to create a new user or edit an existing one. There, you
will find the option to flag the user as external.

By default new users are not set as external users. This behavior can be changed
by an administrator under **Admin > Application Settings**.

### Default internal users

The "Internal users" field allows specifying an e-mail address regex pattern to identify default internal users.

New users whose email address matches the regex pattern will be set to internal by default rather than an external collaborator.

The regex pattern format is Ruby, but it needs to be convertible to JavaScript, and the ignore case flag will be set, e.g. "/regex pattern/i".

Here are some examples:

- Use `\.internal@domain\.com$` to mark email addresses ending with ".internal@domain.com" internal.
- Use `^(?:(?!\.ext@domain\.com).)*$\r?` to mark users with email addresses NOT including .ext@domain.com internal.

Please be aware that this regex could lead to a DOS attack, [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS?) ReDos on Wikipedia.

## Auditor users **[PREMIUM ONLY]**

>[Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/998) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 8.17.

Auditor users are given read-only access to all projects, groups, and other
resources on the GitLab instance.

An Auditor user should be able to access all projects and groups of a GitLab instance
with the permissions described on the documentation on [auditor users permissions](../administration/auditor_users.md#permissions-and-restrictions-of-an-auditor-user).

[Read more about Auditor users.](../administration/auditor_users.md)

## Project features

Project features like wiki and issues can be hidden from users depending on
which visibility level you select on project settings.

- Disabled: disabled for everyone
- Only team members: only team members will see even if your project is public or internal
- Everyone with access: everyone can see depending on your project visibility level
- Everyone: enabled for everyone (only available for GitLab Pages)

## GitLab CI/CD permissions

NOTE: **Note:**
In GitLab 11.0, the Master role was renamed to Maintainer.

GitLab CI/CD permissions rely on the role the user has in GitLab. There are four
permission levels in total:

- admin
- maintainer
- developer
- guest/reporter

The admin user can perform any action on GitLab CI/CD in scope of the GitLab
instance and project. In addition, all admins can use the admin interface under
`/admin/runners`.

### Job permissions

NOTE: **Note:**
In GitLab 11.0, the Master role was renamed to Maintainer.

>**Note:**
GitLab 8.12 has a completely redesigned job permissions system.
Read all about the [new model and its implications](project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.md).

This table shows granted privileges for jobs triggered by specific types of
users:

### New CI job permissions model

GitLab 8.12 has a completely redesigned job permissions system. To learn more,
read through the documentation on the [new CI/CD permissions model](project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.md#new-ci-job-permissions-model).

## Running pipelines on protected branches

The permission to merge or push to protected branches is used to define if a user can
run CI/CD pipelines and execute actions on jobs that are related to those branches.

See [Security on protected branches](../ci/pipelines.md#security-on-protected-branches)
for details about the pipelines security model.

## LDAP users permissions

Since GitLab 8.15, LDAP user permissions can now be manually overridden by an admin user.
Read through the documentation on [LDAP users permissions](../administration/auth/how_to_configure_ldap_gitlab_ee/index.html) to learn more.
