# Reserved project and group names **(FREE)**

Not all project & group names are allowed because they would conflict with
existing routes used by GitLab.

For a list of words that are not allowed to be used as group or project names, see the
[`path_regex.rb` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/path_regex.rb)
under the `TOP_LEVEL_ROUTES`, `PROJECT_WILDCARD_ROUTES` and `GROUP_ROUTES` lists:

- `TOP_LEVEL_ROUTES`: are names that are reserved as usernames or top level groups
- `PROJECT_WILDCARD_ROUTES`: are names that are reserved for child groups or projects.
- `GROUP_ROUTES`: are names that are reserved for all groups or projects.

## Limitations on project and group names

- Special characters are not permitted at the start or end of project or group names. They are permitted in any other location of the name.
- Project or group names cannot end in `.git` or `.atom`.
- Project or group names can only contain letters, digits, emojis, "_", ".", "+", dashes, or spaces.
- Paths can only contain letters, digits, "_", "-", and "."
