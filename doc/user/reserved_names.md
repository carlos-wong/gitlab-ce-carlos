# Reserved project and group names

Not all project & group names are allowed because they would conflict with
existing routes used by GitLab.

For a list of words that are not allowed to be used as group or project names, see the
[`path_regex.rb` file][reserved] under the `TOP_LEVEL_ROUTES`, `PROJECT_WILDCARD_ROUTES` and `GROUP_ROUTES` lists:

- `TOP_LEVEL_ROUTES`: are names that are reserved as usernames or top level groups
- `PROJECT_WILDCARD_ROUTES`: are names that are reserved for child groups or projects.
