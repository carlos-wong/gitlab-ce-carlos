# SCIM provisioning using SAML SSO for Groups **[SILVER ONLY]**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/9388) in [GitLab.com Silver](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 11.10.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), is an open standard that enables the
automation of user provisioning. When SCIM is provisioned for a GitLab group, membership of
that group is synchronized between GitLab and the identity provider.

GitLab's [SCIM API](../../../api/scim.md) implements part of [the RFC7644 protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

Currently, the following actions are available:

- CREATE
- UPDATE
- DELETE (deprovisioning)

The following identity providers are supported:

- Azure

## Requirements

- [Group SSO](index.md) needs to be configured. 
- The `scim_group` feature flag must be enabled:

    Run the following commands in a Rails console:
    
    ```sh
    # Omnibus GitLab
    gitlab-rails console
    
    # Installation from source
    cd /home/git/gitlab
    sudo -u git -H bin/rails console RAILS_ENV=production
    ```
    
    To enable SCIM for a group named `group_name`:
    
    ```ruby
    group = Group.find_by_full_path('group_name')
    Feature.enable(:group_scim, group)
    ```
    
### GitLab configuration

Once [Single sign-on](index.md) has been configured, we can:

1. Navigate to the group and click **Settings > SAML SSO**.
1. Click on the **Generate a SCIM token** button.
1. Save the token and URL so they can be used in the next step.

## SCIM IdP configuration

### Configuration on Azure

In the [Single sign-on](index.md) configuration for the group, make sure
that the **Name identifier value** (NameID) points to a unique identifier, such
as the `user.objectid`. This will match the `extern_uid`  used on GitLab.

The GitLab app in Azure needs to be configured following 
[Azure's SCIM setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups#getting-started).

Note the following:

- The `Tenant URL` and `secret token` are the ones retrieved in the
[previous step](#gitlab-configuration).
- Should there be any problems with the availability of GitLab or similar
errors, the notification email set will get those.
- For mappings, we will only leave `Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to AppName` enabled.

You can then test the connection clicking on `Test Connection`.

### Synchronize Azure Active Directory users

1. Click on `Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to AppName`, to configure
the attribute mapping.
1. Select the unique identifier (in the example `objectId`) as the `id` and `externalId`,
and enable the `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` actions.
1. Map the `userPricipalName` to `emails[type eq "work"].value` and `mailNickname` to
`userName`.

    Example configuration:
    
    ![Azure's attribute mapping configuration](img/scim_attribute_mapping.png)

1. Click on **Show advanced options > Edit attribute list for AppName**.
1. Leave the `id` as the primary and only required field.

    NOTE: **Note:**
    `username` should neither be primary nor required as we don't support
    that field on GitLab SCIM yet.

1. Save all the screens and, in the **Provisioning** step, set
the `Provisioning Status` to `ON`.

    NOTE: **Note:**
    You can control what is actually synced by selecting the `Scope`. For example,
    `Sync only assigned users and groups` will only sync the users assigned to
    the application (`Users and groups`), otherwise it will sync the whole Active Directory.

Once enabled, the synchronization details and any errors will appear on the
bottom of the **Provisioning** screen, together with a link to the audit logs.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
