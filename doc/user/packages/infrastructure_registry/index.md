# Infrastructure Registry **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3221) in GitLab 14.0.

With the GitLab Infrastructure Registry, you can use GitLab projects as a
private registry for infrastructure packages. You can create and publish
packages with GitLab CI/CD, which can then be consumed from other private
projects.

## View packages

To view packages within your project:

1. Go to the project.
1. Go to **Packages & Registries > Infrastructure Registry**.

You can search, sort, and filter packages on this page.

For information on how to create and upload a package, view the GitLab
documentation for your package type:

- [Terraform modules](../terraform_module_registry/index.md)

## Use GitLab CI/CD to build packages

To use [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md) to build packages, you can
authenticate with the [`CI_JOB_TOKEN` predefined variable](../../../ci/variables/predefined_variables.md).

CI/CD templates, which you can use to get started, are in [this repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates).

Learn more about using CI/CD to build:

- [Terraform modules](../terraform_module_registry/index.md#publish-a-terraform-module-by-using-cicd)

If you use CI/CD to build a package, you can find extended activity information
when you view the package details:

![Package CI/CD activity](../package_registry/img/package_activity_v12_10.png)

You can see the pipeline that published the package as well as the commit and the user who triggered it. However, the history is limited to five updates per package.

## Download a package

To download a package:

1. Go to **Packages & Registries > Infrastructure Registry**.
1. Select the name of the package you want to download.
1. In the **Activity** section, select the name of the package you want to download.

## Delete a package

You cannot edit a package after you publish it in the Infrastructure Registry. Instead, you
must delete and recreate it.

To delete a package, you must have suitable [permissions](../../permissions.md).

You can delete packages by using [the API](../../../api/packages.md#delete-a-project-package) or the UI.

To delete a package in the UI, from your project:

1. Go to **Packages & Registries > Infrastructure Registry**.
1. Find the name of the package you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**.

The package is permanently deleted.

## Disable the Infrastructure Registry

The Infrastructure Registry is automatically enabled.

For self-managed instances, a GitLab administrator can
[disable](../../../administration/packages/index.md) **Packages & Registries**,
which removes this menu item from the sidebar.

You can also remove the Infrastructure Registry for a specific project:

1. In your project, go to **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Visibility, project features, permissions** section and toggle **Packages** off (in gray).
1. Select **Save changes**.

To enable it back, follow the same steps above and toggle it on (in blue).

## How module resolution works

When you upload a new module, GitLab generates a path for the module, for example, `https://gitlab.example.com/parent-group/my-infra-package`.

- This path conforms with [the Terraform spec](https://www.terraform.io/internals/module-registry-protocol).
- The name of the path must be unique within the namespace.

For projects in subgroups, GitLab checks that the module name does not already exist anywhere in the namespace, including all subgroups and the parent group.

For example, if:

- The project is `gitlab.example.com/parent-group/sub-group/my-project`.
- The infrastructure package is `my-infra-package`.

The project name must be unique in all projects in all groups under `parent-group`.
