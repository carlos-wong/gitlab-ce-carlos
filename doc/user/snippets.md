# Snippets

With GitLab Snippets you can store and share bits of code and text with other users.

Snippets can be maintained using [snippets API](../api/snippets.md).

There are two types of snippets:

- Personal snippets.
- Project snippets.

## Personal snippets

Personal snippets are not related to any project and can be created completely
independently. There are 3 visibility levels that can be set, public, internal
and private. See [Public access](../public_access/public_access.md) for more information.

## Project snippets

Project snippets are always related to a specific project.
See [Project features](project/index.md#project-features) for more information.

## Discover snippets

There are two main ways of how you can discover snippets in GitLab.

For exploring all snippets that are visible to you, you can go to the Snippets
dashboard of your GitLab instance via the top navigation. For GitLab.com you can
find it [here](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/snippets). This navigates you to an
overview that shows snippets you created and allows you to explore all snippets.

If you want to discover snippets that belong to a specific project, you can navigate
to the Snippets page via the left side navigation on the project page.
Project snippets are enabled and available by default, but they can
be disabled by navigating to your project's **Settings**, expanding
**Visibility, project features, permissions** and scrolling down to
**Snippets**. From there, you can toggle to disable them or select a
different visibility level from the dropdown menu.

## Snippet comments

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/12910) in GitLab 9.2.

With GitLab Snippets you engage in a conversation about that piece of code,
facilitating the collaboration among users.

## Downloading snippets

You can download the raw content of a snippet.

By default snippets will be downloaded with Linux-style line endings (`LF`). If
you want to preserve the original line endings you need to add a parameter `line_ending=raw`
(e.g., `https://gitlab.com/snippets/SNIPPET_ID/raw?line_ending=raw`). In case a
snippet was created using the GitLab web interface the original line ending is Windows-like (`CRLF`).

## Embedded snippets

> Introduced in GitLab 10.8.

Public snippets can not only be shared, but also embedded on any website. This
allows to reuse a GitLab snippet in multiple places and any change to the source
is automatically reflected in the embedded snippet.

To embed a snippet, first make sure that:

- The project is public (if it's a project snippet)
- The snippet is public
- In **Project > Settings > Permissions**, the snippets permissions are
  set to **Everyone with access**

Once the above conditions are met, the "Embed" section will appear in your snippet
where you can simply click on the "Copy to clipboard" button. This copies a one-line
script that you can add to any website or blog post.

Here's how an example code looks like:

```html
<script src="https://gitlab.com/namespace/project/snippets/SNIPPET_ID.js"></script>
```

Here's how an embedded snippet looks like:

<script src="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/snippets/1717978.js"></script>

Embedded snippets are displayed with a header that shows the file name if defined,
the snippet size, a link to GitLab, and the actual snippet content. Actions in
the header allow users to see the snippet in raw format and download it.
