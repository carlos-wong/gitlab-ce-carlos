# GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a tool built into GitLab for software development
through the [continuous methodologies](introduction/index.md#introduction-to-cicd-methodologies):

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)

NOTE: **Out-of-the-box management systems can decrease hours spent on maintaining toolchains by 10% or more.**
Watch our
["Mastering continuous software development"](https://about.gitlab.com/webcast/mastering-ci-cd/)
webcast to learn about continuous methods and how GitLabâ€™s built-in CI can help you simplify and scale software development.

## Overview

Continuous Integration works by pushing small code chunks to your
application's code base hosted in a Git repository, and, to every
push, run a pipeline of scripts to build, test, and validate the
code changes before merging them into the main branch.

Continuous Delivery and Deployment consist of a step further CI,
deploying your application to production at every
push to the default branch of the repository.

These methodologies allow you to catch bugs and errors early in
the development cycle, ensuring that all the code deployed to
production complies with the code standards you established for
your app.

For a complete overview of these methodologies and GitLab CI/CD,
read the [Introduction to CI/CD with GitLab](introduction/index.md).

For a video demonstration of GitLab CI/CD, see [Demo: CI/CD with GitLab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iXFbchozdY).

## Getting started

GitLab CI/CD is configured by a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` placed
at the repository's root. The scripts set in this file are executed
by the [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

To get started with GitLab CI/CD, we recommend you read through
the following documents:

- [How GitLab CI/CD works](introduction/index.md#how-gitlab-cicd-works).
- [GitLab CI/CD basic workflow](introduction/index.md#basic-cicd-workflow).
- [Step-by-step guide for writing `.gitlab-ci.yml` for the first time](../user/project/pages/getting_started_part_four.md).

If you're coming over from Jenkins, you can also check out our handy [reference](jenkins/index.md)
for converting your pipelines.

You can also get started by using one of the
[`.gitlab-ci.yml` templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates)
available through the UI. You can use them by creating a new file,
choosing a template that suits your application, and adjusting it
to your needs:

![Use a .gitlab-ci.yml template](img/add_file_template_11_10.png)

For a broader overview, see the [CI/CD getting started](quick_start/README.md) guide.

Once you're familiar with how GitLab CI/CD works, see the
[`.gitlab-ci.yml` full reference](yaml/README.md)
for all the attributes you can set and use.

NOTE: **Note:**
GitLab CI/CD and [shared runners](runners/README.md#shared-specific-and-group-runners) are enabled in GitLab.com and available for all users, limited only to the [user's pipelines quota](../user/gitlab_com/index.md#shared-runners).
