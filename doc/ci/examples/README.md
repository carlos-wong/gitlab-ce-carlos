# GitLab CI/CD Examples

This page contains links to a variety of examples that can help you understand how to
implement [GitLab CI/CD](../README.md) for your specific use case.

Examples are available in several forms. As a collection of:

- `.gitlab-ci.yml` [template files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates) maintained in GitLab. When you create a new file via the UI,
  GitLab will give you the option to choose one of these templates. This will allow you to quickly bootstrap your project for CI/CD.
  If your favorite programming language or framework are missing, we would love your help by sending a merge request with a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` to this project.
- Repositories with [example projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples) for various languages. You can fork and adjust them to your own needs. Projects include demonstrations of [multi-project pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/multi-project-pipelines) and using [Review Apps with a static site served by nginx](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/review-apps-nginx/).
- Examples and [other resources](#other-resources) listed below.

### Contributing examples

Contributions are welcome! You can help your favorite programming
language users and GitLab by sending a merge request with a guide for that language.
You may want to apply for the [GitLab Community Writers Program](https://about.gitlab.com/community-writers/)
to get paid for writing complete articles for GitLab.

## Adding templates to your GitLab installation **[PREMIUM ONLY]**

If you want to have customized examples and templates for your own self-managed GitLab instance available to your team, your GitLab administrator can [designate an instance template repository](../../user/admin_area/settings/instance_template_repository.md) that contains examples and templates specific to your enterprise.
