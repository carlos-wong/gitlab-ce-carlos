# GitLab CI/CD **(FREE)**

GitLab CI/CD is a tool for software development using the continuous methodologies:

- [Continuous Integration (CI)](introduction/index.md#continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Delivery (CD)](introduction/index.md#continuous-delivery)
- [Continuous Deployment (CD)](introduction/index.md#continuous-deployment)

NOTE:
Out-of-the-box management systems can decrease hours spent on maintaining toolchains by 10% or more.
Watch our ["Mastering continuous software development"](https://about.gitlab.com/webcast/mastering-ci-cd/)
webcast to learn about continuous methods and how GitLab CI/CD can help you simplify and scale software development.

Use GitLab CI/CD to catch bugs and errors early in
the development cycle. Ensure that all the code deployed to
production complies with the code standards you established for
your app.

GitLab CI/CD can automatically build, test, deploy, and
monitor your applications by using [Auto DevOps](../topics/autodevops/index.md).

For a complete overview of these methodologies and GitLab CI/CD,
read the [Introduction to CI/CD with GitLab](introduction/index.md).
