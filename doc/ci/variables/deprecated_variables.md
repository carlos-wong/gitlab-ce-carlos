# Deprecated GitLab CI/CD variables

Read through this document to learn what predefined variables
were deprecated and their new references.

## GitLab 9.0 renamed variables

To follow conventions of naming across GitLab, and to further move away from the
`build` term and toward `job`, some [CI/CD environment variables](README.md#predefined-environment-variables) were renamed for GitLab 9.0
release.

NOTE: **Note:**
Starting with GitLab 9.0, we have deprecated the `$CI_BUILD_*` variables. **You are
strongly advised to use the new variables as we will remove the old ones in
future GitLab releases.**
