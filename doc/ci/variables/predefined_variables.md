# Predefined variables reference **(FREE)**

Predefined [CI/CD variables](index.md) are available in every GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

Some variables are only available with more recent versions of [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

You can [output the values of all variables available for a job](index.md#list-all-environment-variables)
with a `script` command.

There are also [Kubernetes-specific deployment variables (deprecated)](../../user/project/clusters/deploy_to_cluster.md#deployment-variables).

There are also a number of [variables you can use to configure runner behavior](../runners/configure_runners.md#configure-runner-behavior-with-variables) globally or for individual jobs.
