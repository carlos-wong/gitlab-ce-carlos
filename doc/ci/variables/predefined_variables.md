# Predefined environment variables reference

For an introduction on this subject, read through the
[getting started with environment variables](README.md) document.

## Overview

Some of the predefined environment variables are available only if a minimum
version of [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is used. Consult the table below to find the
version of Runner required.

NOTE: **Note:**
Starting with GitLab 9.0, we have deprecated some variables. Read the
[9.0 Renaming](deprecated_variables.md#gitlab-90-renamed-variables) section to find out their replacements. **You are
strongly advised to use the new variables as we will remove the old ones in
future GitLab releases.**
