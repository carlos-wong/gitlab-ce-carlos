# Runner SaaS **(FREE SAAS)**

If you use GitLab SaaS (GitLab.com), your CI jobs automatically run on runners provided by GitLab.
No configuration is required. Your jobs can run on:

- [Linux runners](saas/linux_saas_runner.md).
- [Windows runners](saas/windows_saas_runner.md) ([Beta](../../policy/alpha-beta-support.md#beta-features)).
- [macOS runners](saas/macos_saas_runner.md) ([Beta](../../policy/alpha-beta-support.md#beta-features)).

The number of minutes you can use on these runners depends on the
[maximum number of CI/CD minutes](../pipelines/cicd_minutes.md)
in your [subscription plan](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

If you use self-managed GitLab or you use GitLab.com but want to use your own runners, you can
[install and configure your own runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/).
