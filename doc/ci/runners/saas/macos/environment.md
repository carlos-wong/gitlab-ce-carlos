# VM instances and images for SaaS runners on macOS **(PREMIUM SAAS)**

When you use SaaS runners on macOS:

- Each of your jobs runs in a newly provisioned VM, which is dedicated to the specific job.
- The VM is active only for the duration of the job and immediately deleted.

## VM types

The virtual machine where your job runs has `sudo` access with no password.
For the [Beta](../../../../policy/alpha-beta-support.md#beta-features), there is only one available machine type, `gbc-macos-large`.

| Instance type | vCPUS | Memory (GB) |
| --------- | --- | ------- |
|  `gbc-macos-large` | 4 | 10 |

## VM images

You can execute your build on one of the following images.
You specify this image in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

Each image is running a specific version of macOS and Xcode.
