# GitLab CI/CD artifacts reports types **(FREE)**

Use [`artifacts:reports`](index.md#artifactsreports) to:

- Collect test reports, code quality reports, security reports, and other artifacts generated by included templates in
  jobs.
- Some of these reports are used to display information in:
  - Merge requests.
  - Pipeline views.
  - [Security dashboards](../../user/application_security/security_dashboard/index.md).

The test reports are collected regardless of the job results (success or failure).
You can use [`artifacts:expire_in`](index.md#artifactsexpire_in) to set up an expiration
date for their artifacts.

Some `artifacts:reports` types can be generated by multiple jobs in the same pipeline, and used by merge request or
pipeline features from each job.

To be able to browse the report output files, include the [`artifacts:paths`](index.md#artifactspaths) keyword.

NOTE:
Combined reports in parent pipelines using [artifacts from child pipelines](index.md#needspipelinejob) is
not supported. Track progress on adding support in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215725).

of changes introduced in merge requests.

GitLab can display the results of one or more reports in the merge request
[accessibility widget](../../user/project/merge_requests/accessibility_testing.md#accessibility-merge-request-widget).

## `artifacts:reports:dotenv`

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17066) in GitLab 12.9.

The `dotenv` report collects a set of environment variables as artifacts.

The collected variables are registered as runtime-created variables of the job,
which you can use to [set dynamic environment URLs after a job finishes](../environments/index.md#set-dynamic-environment-urls-after-a-job-finishes).

If duplicate environment variables are present in a `dotenv` report:

- In GitLab 14.6 and later, the last one specified is used.
- In GitLab 14.5 and earlier, an error occurs.

The exceptions to the [original dotenv rules](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules) are:

- The variable key can contain only letters, digits, and underscores (`_`).
- The maximum size of the `.env` file is 5 KB.
  This limit [can be changed on self-managed instances](../../administration/instance_limits.md#limit-dotenv-file-size).
- On GitLab.com, [the maximum number of inherited variables](../../user/gitlab_com/index.md#gitlab-cicd)
  is 50 for Free, 100 for Premium and 150 for Ultimate. The default for
  self-managed instances is 150, and can be changed by changing the
  `dotenv_variables` [application limit](../../administration/instance_limits.md#limit-dotenv-variables).
- Variable substitution in the `.env` file is not supported.
- The `.env` file can't have empty lines or comments (starting with `#`).
- Key values in the `env` file cannot have spaces or newline characters (`\n`), including when using single or double quotes.
- Quote escaping during parsing (`key = 'value'` -> `{key: "value"}`) is not supported.

The `junit` report collects [JUnit report format XML files](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/adfz/developer-for-zos/14.1.0?topic=formats-junit-xml-format).
The collected Unit test reports upload to GitLab as an artifact. Although JUnit was originally developed in Java, there
are many third-party ports for other languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.

See [Unit test reports](../unit_test_reports.md) for more details and examples.
Below is an example of collecting a JUnit report format XML file from Ruby's RSpec test tool:

```yaml
rspec:
  stage: test
  script:
    - bundle install
    - rspec --format RspecJunitFormatter --out rspec.xml
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: rspec.xml
```

GitLab can display the results of one or more reports in:

- The merge request [code quality widget](../../ci/unit_test_reports.md#how-it-works).
- The [full report](../../ci/unit_test_reports.md#viewing-unit-test-reports-on-gitlab).

Some JUnit tools export to multiple XML files. You can specify multiple test report paths in a single job to
concatenate them into a single file. Use either:

- A filename pattern (`junit: rspec-*.xml`).
- an array of filenames (`junit: [rspec-1.xml, rspec-2.xml, rspec-3.xml]`).
- A Combination of both (`junit: [rspec.xml, test-results/TEST-*.xml]`).
