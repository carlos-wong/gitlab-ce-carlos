# Compliance features

You can configure the following GitLab features to help ensure that your GitLab instance meets common compliance standards. Click a feature name for further documentation.

GitLab’s [security features](../security/README.md) may also help you meet relevant compliance standards.

|**[Granular user roles and flexible permissions](../user/permissions.md)**<br>Manage access and permissions with five different user roles and settings for external users.
