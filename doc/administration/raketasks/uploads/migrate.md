# Uploads Migrate Rake Task

## Migrate to Object Storage

After [configuring the object storage](../../uploads.md#using-object-storage-core-only) for GitLab's uploads, you may use this task to migrate existing uploads from the local storage to the remote storage.

>**Note:**
All of the processing will be done in a background worker and requires **no downtime**.

### All-in-one rake task

GitLab provides a wrapper rake task that migrates all uploaded files - avatars,
logos, attachments, favicon, etc. - to object storage in one go. Under the hood,
it invokes individual rake tasks to migrate files falling under each of this
category one by one. The specifications of these individual rake tasks are
described in the next section.

**Omnibus Installation**

```bash
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate:all"
```

**Source Installation**

```bash
sudo RAILS_ENV=production -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:uploads:migrate:all
```

### Individual rake tasks

>**Note:**
If you already ran the rake task mentioned above, no need to run these individual rake tasks as that has been done automatically.

The rake task uses 3 parameters to find uploads to migrate.

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
`uploader_class` | string | Type of the uploader to migrate from
`model_class` | string | Type of the model to migrate from
`mount_point` | string/symbol | Name of the model's column on which the uploader is mounted on.

>**Note:**
These parameters are mainly internal to GitLab's structure, you may want to refer to the task list instead below.

This task also accepts some environment variables which you can use to override
certain values:

Variable | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
`BATCH`   | integer  | Specifies the size of the batch. Defaults to 200.

**Omnibus Installation**

```bash
# gitlab-rake gitlab:uploads:migrate[uploader_class, model_class, mount_point]

# Avatars
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AvatarUploader, Project, :avatar]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AvatarUploader, Group, :avatar]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AvatarUploader, User, :avatar]"

# Attachments
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AttachmentUploader, Note, :attachment]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AttachmentUploader, Appearance, :logo]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AttachmentUploader, Appearance, :header_logo]"

# Favicon
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[FaviconUploader, Appearance, :favicon]"

# Markdown
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[FileUploader, Project]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[PersonalFileUploader, Snippet]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[NamespaceFileUploader, Snippet]"
gitlab-rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[FileUploader, MergeRequest]"
```

**Source Installation**

>**Note:**
Use `RAILS_ENV=production` for every task.

```bash
# sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:uploads:migrate

# Avatars
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AvatarUploader, Project, :avatar]"
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake "gitlab:uploads:migrate[AvatarUploader, Group, :avatar]"
