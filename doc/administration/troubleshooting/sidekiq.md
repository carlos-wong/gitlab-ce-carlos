# Troubleshooting Sidekiq

Sidekiq is the background job processor GitLab uses to asynchronously run
tasks. When things go wrong it can be difficult to troubleshoot. These
situations also tend to be high-pressure because a production system job queue
may be filling up. Users will notice when this happens because new branches
may not show up and merge requests may not be updated. The following are some
troubleshooting steps that will help you diagnose the bottleneck.

> **Note:** GitLab administrators/users should consider working through these
> debug steps with GitLab Support so the backtraces can be analyzed by our team.
> It may reveal a bug or necessary improvement in GitLab.
>
> **Note:** In any of the backtraces, be wary of suspecting cases where every
> thread appears to be waiting in the database, Redis, or waiting to acquire
> a mutex. This **may** mean there's contention in the database, for example,
> but look for one thread that is different than the rest. This other thread

## Thread dump

Send the Sidekiq process ID the `TTIN` signal and it will output thread
backtraces in the log file.

```
kill -TTIN <sidekiq_pid>
```

Check in `/var/log/gitlab/sidekiq/current` or `$GITLAB_HOME/log/sidekiq.log` for
the backtrace output. The backtraces will be lengthy and generally start with
several `WARN` level messages. Here's an example of a single thread's backtrace:

```
2016-04-13T06:21:20.022Z 31517 TID-orn4urby0 WARN: ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Note with 'id'=3375386

/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/lib/gitlab/sidekiq_middleware/arguments_logger.rb:6:in `call'
...
```

In some cases Sidekiq may be hung and unable to respond to the `TTIN` signal.
Move on to other troubleshooting methods if this happens.

## Process profiling with `perf`

Linux has a process profiling tool called `perf` that is helpful when a certain
process is eating up a lot of CPU. If you see high CPU usage and Sidekiq won't
respond to the `TTIN` signal, this is a good next step.

If `perf` is not installed on your system, install it with `apt-get` or `yum`:

```
# Debian
sudo apt-get install linux-tools

# Ubuntu (may require these additional Kernel packages)
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`

# Red Hat/CentOS
sudo yum install perf
```

Run perf against the Sidekiq PID:

```
sudo perf record -p <sidekiq_pid>
```

Let this run for 30-60 seconds and then press Ctrl-C. Then view the perf report:

```
sudo perf report

# Sample output
Samples: 348K of event 'cycles', Event count (approx.): 280908431073
 97.69%            ruby  nokogiri.so         [.] xmlXPathNodeSetMergeAndClear
  0.18%            ruby  libruby.so.2.1.0    [.] objspace_malloc_increase
  0.12%            ruby  libc-2.12.so        [.] _int_malloc
  0.10%            ruby  libc-2.12.so        [.] _int_free
```

Above you see sample output from a perf report. It shows that 97% of the CPU is
being spent inside Nokogiri and `xmlXPathNodeSetMergeAndClear`. For something
this obvious you should then go investigate what job in GitLab would use
Nokogiri and XPath. Combine with `TTIN` or `gdb` output to show the
corresponding Ruby code where this is happening.

## The GNU Project Debugger (gdb)

`gdb` can be another effective tool for debugging Sidekiq. It gives you a little
more interactive way to look at each thread and see what's causing problems.

NOTE: **Note:**
Attaching to a process with `gdb` will suspends the normal operation
of the process (Sidekiq will not process jobs while `gdb` is attached).

Start by attaching to the Sidekiq PID:

```
gdb -p <sidekiq_pid>
```

Then gather information on all the threads:

```
info threads

If you see a suspicious thread, like the Nokogiri one above, you may want
to get more information:

```

To output a backtrace from all threads at once:

```
set pagination off
thread apply all bt
```

Once you're done debugging with `gdb`, be sure to detach from the process and
exit:

```
detach
exit
```

## Check for blocking queries

Sometimes the speed at which Sidekiq processes jobs can be so fast that it can
cause database contention. Check for blocking queries when backtraces above
show that many threads are stuck in the database adapter.

The PostgreSQL wiki has details on the query you can run to see blocking
queries. The query is different based on PostgreSQL version. See
[Lock Monitoring](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Lock_Monitoring) for
the query details.

## Managing Sidekiq queues

It is possible to use [Sidekiq API](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/API)
to perform a number of troubleshoting on Sidekiq.

These are the administrative commands and it should only be used if currently
admin interface is not suitable due to scale of installation.

All this commands should be run using `gitlab-rails console`.

### View the queue size

```ruby
Sidekiq::Queue.new("pipeline_processing:build_queue").size
```

### Enumerate all enqueued jobs

```ruby
queue = Sidekiq::Queue.new("chaos:chaos_sleep")
queue.each do |job|
  # job.klass # => 'MyWorker'
  # job.args # => [1, 2, 3]
  # job.jid # => jid
  # job.queue # => chaos:chaos_sleep
  # job["retry"] # => 3
  # job.item # => {
  #   "class"=>"Chaos::SleepWorker",
  #   "args"=>[1000],
  #   "retry"=>3,
  #   "queue"=>"chaos:chaos_sleep",
  #   "backtrace"=>true,
  #   "queue_namespace"=>"chaos",
  #   "jid"=>"39bc482b823cceaf07213523",
  #   "created_at"=>1566317076.266069,
  #   "correlation_id"=>"c323b832-a857-4858-b695-672de6f0e1af",
  #   "enqueued_at"=>1566317076.26761},
  # }

  # job.delete if job.jid == 'abcdef1234567890'
end
```

### Enumerate currently running jobs

```ruby
workers = Sidekiq::Workers.new
workers.each do |process_id, thread_id, work|
  # process_id is a unique identifier per Sidekiq process
  # thread_id is a unique identifier per thread
  # work is a Hash which looks like:
  # {"queue"=>"chaos:chaos_sleep",
  #  "payload"=>
  #  { "class"=>"Chaos::SleepWorker",
  #    "args"=>[1000],
  #    "retry"=>3,
  #    "queue"=>"chaos:chaos_sleep",
  #    "backtrace"=>true,
  #    "queue_namespace"=>"chaos",
  #    "jid"=>"b2a31e3eac7b1a99ff235869",
  #    "created_at"=>1566316974.9215662,
  #    "correlation_id"=>"e484fb26-7576-45f9-bf21-b99389e1c53c",
  #    "enqueued_at"=>1566316974.9229589},
  #  "run_at"=>1566316974}],
end
```

### Remove Sidekiq jobs for given parameters (destructive)

```ruby
# for jobs like this:
# RepositoryImportWorker.new.perform_async(100)
id_list = [100]

queue = Sidekiq::Queue.new('repository_import')
queue.each do |job|
  job.delete if id_list.include?(job.args[0])
end
```

### Remove specific job ID (destructive)

```ruby
queue = Sidekiq::Queue.new('repository_import')
queue.each do |job|
  job.delete if job.jid == 'my-job-id'
end
```

## Canceling running jobs (destructive)

> Introduced in GitLab 12.3.

This is highly risky operation and use it as last resort.
Doing that might result in data corruption, as the job
is interrupted mid-execution and it is not guaranteed
that proper rollback of transactions is implemented.

```ruby
Gitlab::SidekiqDaemon::Monitor.cancel_job('job-id')
```

> This requires the Sidekiq to be run with `SIDEKIQ_MONITOR_WORKER=1`
> environment variable.

To perform of the interrupt we use `Thread.raise` which
has number of drawbacks, as mentioned in [Why Ruby’s Timeout is dangerous (and Thread.raise is terrifying)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/27/why-rubys-timeout-is-dangerous-and-thread-dot-raise-is-terrifying/):

> This is where the implications get interesting, and terrifying. This means that an exception can get raised:
>
> - during a network request (ok, as long as the surrounding code is prepared to catch Timeout::Error)
> - during the cleanup for the network request
> - during a rescue block
> - while creating an object to save to the database afterwards
> - in any of your code, regardless of whether it could have possibly raised an exception before
>
> Nobody writes code to defend against an exception being raised on literally any line. That’s not even possible. So Thread.raise is  basically like a sneak attack on your code that could result in almost anything. It would probably be okay if it were pure-functional code that did not modify any state. But this is Ruby, so that’s unlikely :)
