# PostgreSQL **(FREE SELF)**

This page contains information about PostgreSQL the GitLab Support team uses
when troubleshooting. GitLab makes this information public, so that anyone can
make use of the Support team's collected knowledge.

WARNING:
Some procedures documented here may break your GitLab instance. Use at your
own risk.

If you're on a [paid tier](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) and aren't sure
how to use these commands, [contact Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/)
for assistance with any issues you're having.

  To fix this, see [Backup and restore a non-packaged PostgreSQL database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#backup-and-restore-a-non-packaged-postgresql-database).

- Deploying PostgreSQL on Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server may result in an error stating `extension "btree_gist" is not allow-listed for "azure_pg_admin" users in Azure Database for PostgreSQL`

  To resolve the above error, [allow-list the extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-extensions#how-to-use-postgresql-extensions) prior to install.

### Database deadlocks

  Provided for context about how GitLab code can have this sort of
  unanticipated effect in unusual situations.

```plaintext
ERROR: deadlock detected
```

Three applicable timeouts are identified in the issue [#30528](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30528); our recommended settings are as follows:

```ini
deadlock_timeout = 5s
statement_timeout = 15s
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 60s
```

Quoting from issue [#30528](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30528):

<!-- vale gitlab.FutureTense = NO -->

> "If a deadlock is hit, and we resolve it through aborting the transaction after a short period, then the retry mechanisms we already have will make the deadlocked piece of work try again, and it's unlikely we'll deadlock multiple times in a row."

<!-- vale gitlab.FutureTense = YES -->

NOTE:
In Support, our general approach to reconfiguring timeouts (applies also to the
HTTP stack) is that it's acceptable to do it temporarily as a workaround. If it
makes GitLab usable for the customer, then it buys time to understand the
problem more completely, implement a hot fix, or make some other change that
addresses the root cause. Generally, the timeouts should be put back to
reasonable defaults after the root cause is resolved.

In this case, the guidance we had from development was to drop `deadlock_timeout`
or `statement_timeout`, but to leave the third setting at 60 seconds. Setting
`idle_in_transaction` protects the database from sessions potentially hanging for
days. There's more discussion in [the issue relating to introducing this timeout on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/1053).

PostgresSQL defaults:

- `statement_timeout = 0` (never)
- `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0` (never)

Comments in issue [#30528](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30528)
indicate that these should both be set to at least a number of minutes for all
Omnibus GitLab installations (so they don't hang indefinitely). However, 15s
for `statement_timeout` is very short, and is only effective if the
underlying infrastructure is very performant.

See current settings with:

```shell
sudo gitlab-rails runner "c = ApplicationRecord.connection ; puts c.execute('SHOW statement_timeout').to_a ;
puts c.execute('SHOW deadlock_timeout').to_a ;
puts c.execute('SHOW idle_in_transaction_session_timeout').to_a ;"
```

It may take a little while to respond.

```ruby
{"statement_timeout"=>"1min"}
{"deadlock_timeout"=>"0"}
{"idle_in_transaction_session_timeout"=>"1min"}
```

These settings can be updated in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` with:

```ruby
postgresql['deadlock_timeout'] = '5s'
postgresql['statement_timeout'] = '15s'
postgresql['idle_in_transaction_session_timeout'] = '60s'
```

Once saved, [reconfigure GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure) for the changes to take effect.

NOTE:
These are Omnibus GitLab settings. If an external database, such as a customer's PostgreSQL installation or Amazon RDS is being used, these values don't get set, and would have to be set externally.

### Temporarily changing the statement timeout

WARNING:
The following advice does not apply in case
[PgBouncer](../postgresql/pgbouncer.md) is enabled,
because the changed timeout might affect more transactions than intended.

In some situations, it may be desirable to set a different statement timeout
without having to [reconfigure GitLab](../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-reconfigure),
which in this case would restart Puma and Sidekiq.

For example, a backup may fail with the following errors in the output of the
[backup command](../../raketasks/backup_restore.md#back-up-gitlab)
because the statement timeout was too short:

```plaintext
pg_dump: error: Error message from server: server closed the connection unexpectedly
```

You may also see errors in the [PostgreSQL logs](../logs.md#postgresql-logs):

```plaintext
canceling statement due to statement timeout
```

To temporarily change the statement timeout:

1. Open `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc/database.yml` in an editor
1. Set the value of `statement_timeout` to `0`, which sets an unlimited statement timeout.
1. [Confirm in a new Rails console session](../operations/rails_console.md#using-the-rails-runner)
   that this value is used:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-rails runner "ActiveRecord::Base.connection_config[:variables]"
   ```

1. Perform the action for which you need a different timeout
   (for example the backup or the Rails command).
1. Revert the edit in `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc/database.yml`.
