# Performing operations in GitLab **(FREE SELF)**

Keep your GitLab instance up and running smoothly.

- [Rake tasks](../../raketasks/index.md): Tasks for common administration and operational processes such as
  [cleaning up unneeded items from GitLab instance](../../raketasks/cleanup.md), integrity checks,
  and more.
- [Moving repositories](moving_repositories.md): Moving all repositories managed
  by GitLab to another file system or another server.
- [Sidekiq MemoryKiller](sidekiq_memory_killer.md): Configure Sidekiq MemoryKiller
  to restart Sidekiq.
- [Multiple Sidekiq processes](extra_sidekiq_processes.md): Configure multiple Sidekiq processes to ensure certain queues always have dedicated workers, no matter the number of jobs that must be processed. **(FREE SELF)**
- [Sidekiq routing rules](extra_sidekiq_routing.md): Configure the routing rules to route a job from a worker to a desirable queue. **(FREE SELF)**
- [Puma](puma.md): Understand Puma and puma-worker-killer.

  indexed lookup to the GitLab database](fast_ssh_key_lookup.md), and/or
  by [doing away with user SSH keys stored on GitLab entirely in favor
  of SSH certificates](ssh_certificates.md).
- [File System Performance Benchmarking](filesystem_benchmarking.md): File system
  performance can have a big impact on GitLab performance, especially for actions
  that read or write Git repositories. This information helps benchmark
  file system performance against known good and bad real-world systems.
- [The Rails Console](rails_console.md): Provides a way to interact with your GitLab instance from the command line.
  Used for troubleshooting a problem or retrieving some data that can only be done through direct access to GitLab.
- [ChatOps Scripts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chatops): The GitLab.com Infrastructure team uses this repository to house
  common ChatOps scripts they use to troubleshoot and maintain the production instance of GitLab.com.
