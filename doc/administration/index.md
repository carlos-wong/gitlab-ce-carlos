# Administrator Docs **(CORE ONLY)**

Learn how to administer your self-managed GitLab instance.

GitLab has two product distributions available through [different subscriptions](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/):

- The open source [GitLab Community Edition (CE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss).
- The open core [GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab).

You can [install either GitLab CE or GitLab EE](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/).
However, the features you'll have access to depend on the subscription you choose
(Core, Starter, Premium, or Ultimate).

NOTE: **Note:**
GitLab Community Edition installations only have access to Core features.

GitLab.com is administered by GitLab, Inc., therefore, only GitLab team members have
access to its admin configurations. If you're a GitLab.com user, please check the
[user documentation](../user/index.md).

NOTE: **Note:**
Non-administrator users donâ€™t have access to GitLab administration tools and settings.

### Support Team Docs

The GitLab Support Team has collected a lot of information about troubleshooting GitLab
instances. These documents are normally used by the Support Team itself, or by customers
with direct guidance from a Support Team member. GitLab administrators may find the
information useful for troubleshooting, but if you are experiencing trouble with your
GitLab instance, you should check your [support options](https://about.gitlab.com/support/)
before referring to these documents.

CAUTION: **Warning:**
