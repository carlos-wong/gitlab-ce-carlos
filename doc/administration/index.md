# Administrator documentation **(FREE SELF)**

If you use GitLab.com, only GitLab team members have access to administration tools and settings.
If you use a self-managed GitLab instance, learn how to administer it.

Only administrator users can access GitLab administration tools and settings.

## Available distributions

GitLab has two product distributions available through [different subscriptions](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/):

- The open source [GitLab Community Edition (CE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss).
- The open core [GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab).

You can [install either GitLab CE or GitLab EE](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/).
However, the features you have access to depend on your chosen subscription.

GitLab Community Edition installations have access only to Free features.
