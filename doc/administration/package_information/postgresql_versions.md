# PostgreSQL versions shipped with Omnibus GitLab **(FREE SELF)**

NOTE:
This table lists only GitLab versions where a significant change happened in the
package regarding PostgreSQL versions, not all.

Usually, PostgreSQL versions change with major or minor GitLab releases. However, patch versions
of Omnibus GitLab sometimes update the patch level of PostgreSQL.

For example:

- Omnibus 12.7.6 shipped with PostgreSQL 9.6.14 and 10.9.
- Omnibus 12.7.7 shipped with PostgreSQL 9.6.17 and 10.12.

[Find out which versions of PostgreSQL (and other components) ship with
each Omnibus GitLab release](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/licenses.html).

Read more about update policies and warnings in the PostgreSQL
[upgrade docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).
