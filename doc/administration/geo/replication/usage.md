# Using a Geo Site **(PREMIUM SELF)**

After you set up the [database replication and configure the Geo nodes](../index.md#setup-instructions), use your closest GitLab site as you would do with the primary one.

You can push directly to a **secondary** site (for both HTTP, SSH including
Git LFS), and the request will be proxied to the primary site instead.

Example of the output you will see when pushing to a **secondary** site:

```shell
$ git push
remote:
remote: This request to a Geo secondary node will be forwarded to the
remote: Geo primary node:
remote:
remote:   ssh://git@primary.geo/user/repo.git
remote:
Everything up-to-date
```

NOTE:
If you're using HTTPS instead of [SSH](../../../user/ssh.md) to push to the secondary,
you can't store credentials in the URL like `user:password@URL`. Instead, you can use a
[`.netrc` file](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html)
for Unix-like operating systems or `_netrc` for Windows. In that case, the credentials
will be stored as a plain text. If you're looking for a more secure way to store credentials,
you can use [Git Credential Storage](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage).

## Fetch Go modules from Geo secondary sites

Go modules can be pulled from secondary sites, with a number of limitations:

- Git configuration (using `insteadOf`) is needed to fetch data from the Geo secondary site.
- For private projects, authentication details need to be specified in `~/.netrc`.

Read more in the
[working with projects `go get` documentation](../../../user/project/working_with_projects.md#fetch-go-modules-from-geo-secondary-sites).
