# GitLab Prometheus metrics **(FREE SELF)**

To enable the GitLab Prometheus metrics:

1. Log in to GitLab as a user with administrator access.
1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Admin**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Metrics and profiling**.
1. Find the **Metrics - Prometheus** section, and select **Add link to Prometheus**.
1. [Restart GitLab](../../restart_gitlab.md#omnibus-gitlab-restart) for the changes to take effect.

For installations from source you must configure it yourself.

## Collecting the metrics

GitLab monitors its own internal service metrics, and makes them available at the
`/-/metrics` endpoint. Unlike other [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) exporters, to access
the metrics, the client IP address must be [explicitly allowed](../ip_whitelist.md).

These metrics are enabled and collected for [Omnibus GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/)
and Chart installations. For source installations, these metrics must be enabled
manually and collected by a Prometheus server.

For enabling and viewing metrics from Sidekiq nodes, see [Sidekiq metrics](#sidekiq-metrics).

## Metrics available

The following metrics are available:

## Metrics controlled by a feature flag

The following metrics can be controlled by feature flags:

| Metric                                                         | Feature Flag                                                       |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Praefect metrics

You can [configure Praefect](../../gitaly/praefect.md#praefect) to report metrics. For information
on available metrics, see the [relevant documentation](../../gitaly/index.md#monitor-gitaly-cluster).

## Sidekiq metrics

Sidekiq jobs may also gather metrics, and these metrics can be accessed if the
Sidekiq exporter is enabled: for example, using the `monitoring.sidekiq_exporter`
configuration option in `gitlab.yml`. These metrics are served from the
`/metrics` path on the configured port.

These metrics record the status of the database
[connection pools](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/ConnectionPool.html),
and the metrics all have these labels:

- `class` - the Ruby class being recorded.
  - `ActiveRecord::Base` is the main database connection.
  - `Geo::TrackingBase` is the connection to the Geo tracking database, if
    enabled.
- `host` - the host name used to connect to the database.
- `port` - the port used to connect to the database.

## Redis metrics

These client metrics are meant to complement Redis server metrics.
These metrics are broken down per [Redis
instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/redis.html#running-with-multiple-redis-instances).
These metrics all have a `storage` label which indicates the Redis
instance (`cache`, `shared_state`, and so on).

## Metrics shared directory

The GitLab Prometheus client requires a directory to store metrics data shared between multi-process services.
Those files are shared among all instances running under Puma server.
The directory must be accessible to all running Puma's processes, or
metrics can't function correctly.

This directory's location is configured using environment variable `prometheus_multiproc_dir`.
For best performance, create this directory in `tmpfs`.

If GitLab is installed using [Omnibus GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/)
and `tmpfs` is available, then GitLab configures the metrics directory for you.
