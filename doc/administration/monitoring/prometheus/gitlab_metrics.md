# GitLab Prometheus metrics

>**Note:**
Available since [Omnibus GitLab 9.3][29118]. For
installations from source you'll have to configure it yourself.

To enable the GitLab Prometheus metrics:

1. Log into GitLab as an administrator, and go to the Admin area.
1. Click on the gear, then click on Settings.
1. Find the `Metrics - Prometheus` section, and click `Enable Prometheus Metrics`
1. [Restart GitLab][restart] for the changes to take effect

## Collecting the metrics

GitLab monitors its own internal service metrics, and makes them available at the
`/-/metrics` endpoint. Unlike other [Prometheus] exporters, in order to access
it, the client IP needs to be [included in a whitelist][whitelist].

For Omnibus and Chart installations, these metrics are automatically enabled and collected as of [GitLab 9.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/1702). For source installations or earlier versions, these metrics will need to be enabled manually and collected by a Prometheus server.

## Unicorn Metrics available

### Ruby metrics

Some basic Ruby runtime metrics are available:

| Metric                                 | Type      | Since | Description |
|:-------------------------------------- |:--------- |:----- |:----------- |
| ruby_gc_duration_seconds_total         | Counter   | 11.1  | Time spent by Ruby in GC |
| ruby_gc_stat_...                       | Gauge     | 11.1  | Various metrics from [GC.stat] |
| ruby_file_descriptors                  | Gauge     | 11.1  | File descriptors per process |
| ruby_memory_bytes                      | Gauge     | 11.1  | Memory usage by process |
| ruby_sampler_duration_seconds_total    | Counter   | 11.1  | Time spent collecting stats |

## Metrics shared directory

GitLab's Prometheus client requires a directory to store metrics data shared between multi-process services.
Those files are shared among all instances running under Unicorn server.
The directory needs to be accessible to all running Unicorn's processes otherwise
metrics will not function correctly.

For best performance its advisable that this directory will be located in `tmpfs`.

Its location is configured using environment variable `prometheus_multiproc_dir`.

If GitLab is installed using Omnibus and `tmpfs` is available then metrics
directory will be automatically configured.
