# frozen_string_literal: true

# This module contains a Ruby port of Python logic from the `get_tests` method of the
# `spec_test.py` script (see copy of original code in a comment at the bottom of this file):
# https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/blob/5dfedc7/test/spec_tests.py#L82
#
# The logic and structure is as unchanged as possible from the original Python - no
# cleanup or refactoring was done.
#
# Changes from the original logic were made to follow Ruby/GitLab syntax, idioms, and linting rules.
#
# Additional logic was also added to:
# 1. Capture all nested headers, not just the most recent.
# 2. Raise an exception if an unexpected state is encountered.
#
# Comments indicate where changes, deletions, or additions were made.
#
# See more detailed documentation of rules regarding the handling of headers
# in the comments at the top of `Glfm::UpdateExampleSnapshots#add_example_names`,
# in `scripts/lib/glfm/update_example_snapshots.rb`
