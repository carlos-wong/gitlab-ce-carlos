    Manual iteration management is deprecated and only automatic iteration cadences will be supported in the future.

    Creating and deleting iterations will be fully removed in 16.0. Updating all iteration fields except for
    `description` will also be removed.

    On the GraphQL API the following mutations will be removed:

      1. `iterationCreate`
      1. `iterationDelete`

    The update `updateIteration` mutation will only allow updating the iteration's `description`. The following
    arguments will be removed:

      1. `title`
      1. `dueDate`
      1. `startDate`

    For more information about iteration cadences, you can refer to
    [the documentation of the feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/#iteration-cadences).
