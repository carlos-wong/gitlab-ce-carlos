    As Advanced Search migrations usually require support multiple code paths for a long period of time, itâ€™s important to clean those up when we safely can. We use GitLab major version upgrades as a safe time to remove backward compatibility for indices that have not been fully migrated. See the [upgrade documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/index.html#upgrading-to-a-new-major-version) for details.
