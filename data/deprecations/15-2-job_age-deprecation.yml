    The `job_age` parameter, returned from the `POST /jobs/request` API endpoint used in communication with GitLab Runner, was never used by any GitLab or Runner feature. This parameter will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

    This could be a breaking change for anyone that developed their own runner that relies on this parameter being returned by the endpoint. This is not a breaking change for anyone using an officially released version of GitLab Runner, including public shared runners on GitLab.com.
