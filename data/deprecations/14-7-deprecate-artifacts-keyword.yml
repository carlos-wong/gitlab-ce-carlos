     Currently, test coverage visualizations in GitLab only support Cobertura reports. Starting 15.0, the
     `artifacts:reports:cobertura` keyword will be replaced by
     [`artifacts:reports:coverage_report`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344533). Cobertura will be the
     only supported report file in 15.0, but this is the first step towards GitLab supporting other report types.

# The following items are not published on the docs page, but may be used in the future.
