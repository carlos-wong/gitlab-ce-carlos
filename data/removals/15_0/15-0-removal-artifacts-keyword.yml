     As of GitLab 15.0, the [`artifacts:reports:cobertura`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportscobertura-removed)
     keyword has been [replaced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344533) by
     [`artifacts:reports:coverage_report`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportscoverage_report).
     Cobertura is the only supported report file, but this is the first step towards GitLab supporting other report types.

# The following items are not published on the docs page, but may be used in the future.
