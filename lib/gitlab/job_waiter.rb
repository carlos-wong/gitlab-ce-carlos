  # JobWaiter can be used to wait for a number of Sidekiq jobs to complete.
  #
  # Its use requires the cooperation of the sidekiq jobs themselves. Set up the
  # waiter, then start the jobs, passing them its `key`. Their `perform` methods
  # should look like:
  #
  #     def perform(args, notify_key)
  #       # do work
  #     ensure
  #       ::Gitlab::JobWaiter.notify(notify_key, jid)
  #     end
  #
  # The JobWaiter blocks popping items from a Redis array. All the sidekiq jobs
  # push to that array when done. Once the waiter has popped `count` items, it
  # knows all the jobs are done.
