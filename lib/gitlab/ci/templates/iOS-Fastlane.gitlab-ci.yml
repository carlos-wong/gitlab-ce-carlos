# This is a very simple template that mainly relies on FastLane to build and distribute your app.
# Read more about how to use this template on the blog post https://about.gitlab.com/2019/03/06/ios-publishing-with-gitlab-and-fastlane/
# You will also need fastlane and signing configuration for this to work, along with a MacOS runner. 
# These details are provided in the blog post.

# Note that when you're using the shell executor for MacOS builds, the
# build and tests run as the identity of the runner logged in user, directly on
# the build host. This is less secure than using container executors, so please
# take a look at our security implications documentation at 
# https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/#usage-of-shell-executor for additional 
# detail on what to keep in mind in this scenario.
