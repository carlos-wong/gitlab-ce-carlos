# Gitlab::EventStore is a simple pub-sub mechanism that lets you publish
# domain events and use Sidekiq workers as event handlers.
#
# It can be used to decouple domains from different bounded contexts
# by publishing domain events and let any interested parties subscribe
# to them.

    # Define all event subscriptions using:
