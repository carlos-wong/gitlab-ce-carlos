    # EncryptColumn migrates data from an unencrypted column - `foo`, say - to
    # an encrypted column - `encrypted_foo`, say.
    #
    # We only create a subclass here because we want to isolate this migration
    # (migrating unencrypted runner registration tokens to encrypted columns)
    # from other `EncryptColumns` migration. This class name is going to be
    # serialized and stored in Redis and later picked by Sidekiq, so we need to
    # create a separate class name in order to isolate these migration tasks.
    #
    # We can solve this differently, see tech debt issue:
