  # The SidekiqStatus module and its child classes can be used for checking if a
  # Sidekiq job has been processed or not.
  #
  # To check if a job has been completed, simply pass the job ID to the
  # `completed?` method:
  #
  #     job_id = SomeWorker.perform_async(...)

  # much faster than using Sidekiq's built-in job finding/status API. These keys
  # expire after a certain period of time to prevent storing too many keys in
  # Redis.
