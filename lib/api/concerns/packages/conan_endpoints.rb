# Conan Package Manager Client API
#
# These API endpoints are not consumed directly by users, so there is no documentation for the
# individual endpoints. They are called by the Conan package manager client when users run commands
# like `conan install` or `conan upload`. The usage of the GitLab Conan repository is documented here:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/conan_repository/#installing-a-package
