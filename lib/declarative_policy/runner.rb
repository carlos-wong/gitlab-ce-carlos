    # This is the core spot where all those `#score` methods matter.
    # It is critical for performance to run steps in the correct order,
    # so that we don't compute expensive conditions (potentially n times
    # if we're called on, say, a large list of users).
    #
    # In order to determine the cheapest step to run next, we rely on
    # Step#score, which returns a numerical rating of how expensive
    # it would be to calculate - the lower the better. It would be
    # easy enough to statically sort by these scores, but we can do
    # a little better - the scores are cache-aware (conditions that
    # are already in the cache have score 0), which means that running
    # a step can actually change the scores of other steps.
    #
    # So! The way we sort here involves re-scoring at every step. This
    # is by necessity quadratic, but most of the time the number of steps
    # will be low. But just in case, if the number of steps exceeds 50,
    # we print a warning and fall back to a static sort.

    # for debugging purposes.
