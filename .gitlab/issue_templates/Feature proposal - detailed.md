<!-- The first section "Release notes" is required if you want to have your release post blog MR auto generated. Currently in BETA, details on the **release post item generator** can be found in the handbook:  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfn9ebgTwKg. The next four sections: "Problem to solve", "Intended users", "User experience goal", and "Proposal", are strongly recommended in your first draft, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. -->

### Release notes

<!-- What is the problem and solution you're proposing? This content sets the overall vision for the feature and serves as the release notes that will populate in various places, including the [release post blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and [Gitlab project releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases). " -->

### Problem to solve

<!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, "As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value)." -->

### Intended users

<!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write "Unknown" and fill this field in later.

### User experience goal

<!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses?
For example, "The user should be able to use the UI/API/.gitlab-ci.yml with GitLab to <perform a specific task>"
https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/user-story-mapping/ -->

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey -->

### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. -->

### Permissions and Security

<!-- What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?
Consider adding checkboxes and expectations of users with certain levels of membership https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html
* [ ] Add expected impact to members with no access (0)
* [ ] Add expected impact to Guest (10) members
* [ ] Add expected impact to Reporter (20) members
* [ ] Add expected impact to Developer (30) members
* [ ] Add expected impact to Maintainer (40) members
* [ ] Add expected impact to Owner (50) members

Please consider performing a threat model for the code changes that are introduced as part of this feature. To get started, refer to our Threat Modeling handbook page https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/threat_modeling/#threat-modeling.

Don't hesitate to reach out to the Application Security Team (`@gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec`) to discuss any security concerns.

### Feature Usage Metrics

<!-- How are you going to track usage of this feature? Think about user behavior and their interaction with the product. What indicates someone is getting value from it?

Create tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md

-->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!--
Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.

Create tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md

### What is the type of buyer?

<!-- What is the buyer persona for this feature? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/
In which enterprise tier should this feature go? See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/#three-tiers -->

### Is this a cross-stage feature?

<!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features -->
