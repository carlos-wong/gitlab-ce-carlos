### Prior to starting the security release work

- [ ] Read the [security process for developers] if you are not familiar with it.
- [ ] Link to the original issue adding it to the [links section](#links)
- [ ] Run `scripts/security-harness` in the CE, EE, and/or Omnibus to prevent pushing to any remote besides `dev.gitlab.org`
- [ ] Create a new branch prefixing it with `security-`
- [ ] Create a MR targeting `dev.gitlab.org` `master`
- [ ] Add a link to this issue in the original security issue on `gitlab.com`.

#### Backports

- [ ] Once the MR is ready to be merged, create MRs targetting the last 3 releases, plus the current RC if between the 7th and 22nd of the month.
    - [ ] At this point, it might be easy to squash the commits from the MR into one
    - You can use the script `bin/secpick` instead of the following steps, to help you cherry-picking. See the [secpick documentation]
    - [ ] Create each MR targetting the stable branch `X-Y-stable`, using the "Security Release" merge request template.
    - Every merge request will have its own set of TODOs, so make sure to
      complete those.
- [ ] Make sure all MRs have a link in the [links section](#links)
