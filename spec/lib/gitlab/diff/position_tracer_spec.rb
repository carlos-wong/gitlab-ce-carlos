  # Douwe's diary                                    New York City, 2016-06-28
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Dear diary,
  #
  # Ideally, we would have a test for every single diff scenario that can
  # occur and that the PositionTracer should correctly trace a position
  # through, across the following variables:
  #
  # - Old diff file type: created, changed, renamed, deleted, unchanged (5)
  # - Old diff line type: added, removed, unchanged (3)
  # - New diff file type: created, changed, renamed, deleted, unchanged (5)
  # - New diff line type: added, removed, unchanged (3)
  # - Old-to-new diff line change: kept, moved, undone (3)
  #
  # This adds up to 5 * 3 * 5 * 3 * 3 = 675 different potential scenarios,
  # and 675 different tests to cover them all. In reality, it would be fewer,
  # since one cannot have a removed line in a created file diff, for example,
  # but for the sake of this diary entry, let's be pessimistic.
  #
  # Writing these tests is a manual and time consuming process, as every test
  # requires the manual construction or finding of a combination of diffs that
  # create the exact diff scenario we are looking for, and can take between
  # 1 and 10 minutes, depending on the farfetchedness of the scenario and
  # complexity of creating it.
  #
  # This means that writing tests to cover all of these scenarios would end up
  # taking between 11 and 112 hours in total, which I do not believe is the
  # best use of my time.
  #
  # A better course of action would be to think of scenarios that are likely
  # to occur, but also potentially tricky to trace correctly, and only cover
  # those, with a few more obvious scenarios thrown in to cover our bases.
  #
  # Unfortunately, I only came to the above realization once I was about
  # 1/5th of the way through the process of writing ALL THE SPECS, having
  # already wasted about 3 hours trying to be thorough.
  #
  # I did find 2 bugs while writing those though, so that's good.
  #
  # In any case, all of this means that the tests below will be extremely
  # (excessively, unjustifiably) thorough for scenarios where "the file was
  # created in the old diff" and then drop off to comparatively lackluster
  # testing of other scenarios.
  #
  # I did still try to cover most of the obvious and potentially tricky
  # scenarios, though.
