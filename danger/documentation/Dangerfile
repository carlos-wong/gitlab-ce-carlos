## Documentation review

The following files will require a review from the [Technical Writing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/technical-writing/) team:

* #{docs_paths_to_review.map { |path| "`#{path}`" }.join("\n* ")}

Per the [documentation workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html), the review may occur prior to merging this MR **or** after a maintainer has agreed to review and merge this MR without a tech writer review. (Meanwhile, you are welcome to involve a technical writer at any time if you have questions about writing or updating the documentation. GitLabbers are also welcome to use the [#docs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C16HYA2P5) channel on Slack.)

The technical writer who, by default, will review this content or collaborate as needed is dependent on the [DevOps stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) to which the content applies:

| Tech writer  | Stage(s)                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@marcia`    | ~Create ~Release + ~"development guidelines"                 |
| `@axil`      | ~Distribution ~Gitaly ~Gitter ~Monitor ~Package ~Secure      |
| `@eread`     | ~Manage ~Configure ~Geo ~Verify                              |
| `@mikelewis` | ~Plan                                                        |
