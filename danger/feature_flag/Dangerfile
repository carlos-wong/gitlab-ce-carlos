  You're about to [release the feature with the feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Flag%20Roll%20Out.md#optional-release-the-feature-with-the-feature-flag).
  This process can only be done **after** the [global rollout on production](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Flag%20Roll%20Out.md#global-rollout-on-production).
  Please make sure in [the rollout issue](#{feature_flag.rollout_issue_url}) that the preliminary steps have already been done. Otherwise, changing the YAML definition might not have the desired effect.
