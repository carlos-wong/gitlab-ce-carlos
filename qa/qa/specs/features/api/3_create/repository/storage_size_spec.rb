      # Previously, GitLab could report a size many times larger than a cloned copy. For example, 37Gb reported for a
      # repo that is 2Gb when cloned.
      #
      # After changing Gitaly to use `git rev-list` to determine the size of a repo, the reported size is much more
      # accurate. Nonetheless, the size of a clone is still not necessarily the same as the original. We can't do a
      # precise comparison because of the non-deterministic nature of how git packs files. Depending on the history of
      # the repository the sizes can vary considerably. For example, at the time of writing this a clone of
      # www-gitlab-com was 5.27Gb, about 5% smaller than the size GitLab reported, 5.51Gb.
      #
      # There are unit tests to verify the accuracy of GitLab's determination of repo size, so for this test we
      # attempt to detect large differences that could indicate a regression to previous behavior.
