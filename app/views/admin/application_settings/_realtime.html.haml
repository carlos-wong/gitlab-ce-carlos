        Change this value to influence how frequently the GitLab UI polls for updates.
        If you set the value to 2 all polling intervals are multiplied
        by 2, which means that polling happens half as frequently.
        The multiplier can also have a decimal value.
        The default value (1) is a reasonable choice for the majority of GitLab
        installations. Set to 0 to completely disable polling.
