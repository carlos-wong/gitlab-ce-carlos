# Mounted uploaders are destroyed by carrierwave's after_commit
# hook. This hook fetches upload location (local vs remote) from
# Upload model. So it's necessary to make sure that during that
# after_commit hook model's associated uploads are not deleted yet.
# IOW we can not use dependent: :destroy :
# has_many :uploads, as: :model, dependent: :destroy
#
# And because not-mounted uploads require presence of upload's
# object model when destroying them (FileUploader's `build_upload` method
# references `model` on delete), we can not use after_commit hook for these
# uploads.
#
# Instead FileUploads are destroyed in before_destroy hook and remaining uploads
# are destroyed by the carrierwave's after_commit hook.
