  # When notes on a commit are displayed in context of a merge request that contains that commit,

  # individual notes on the commit with different discussion IDs, so that it's clear that these are not
  # notes on the merge request itself.
  #
  # To turn a list of notes into a list of discussions, they are grouped by discussion ID, so to
  # get these out-of-context notes to end up in the same discussion, we need to get them to return the same
  # `discussion_id` when this grouping happens. To enable this, `Note#discussion_id` calls out
  # to the `override_discussion_id` method on the appropriate `Discussion` subclass, as determined by
  # the `discussion_class` method on `Note` or a subclass of `Note`.
