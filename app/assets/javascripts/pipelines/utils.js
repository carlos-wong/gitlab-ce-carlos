    The following functions are the main engine in transforming the data as
    received from the endpoint into the format the d3 graph expects.

    Input is of the form:
    [nodes]
      nodes: [{category, name, jobs, size}]
        category is the stage name
        name is a group name; in the case that the group has one job, it is
          also the job name
        size is the number of parallel jobs
        jobs: [{ name, needs}]
          job name is either the same as the group name or group x/y
          needs: [job-names]
          needs is an array of job-name strings

    Output is of the form:
    { nodes: [node], links: [link] }
      node: { name, category }, + unused info passed through
      link: { source, target, value }, with source & target being node names
        and value being a constant

    We create nodes in the GraphQL update function, and then here we create the node dictionary,
    then create links, and then dedupe the links, so that in the case where
    job 4 depends on job 1 and job 2, and job 2 depends on job 1, we show only a single link
    from job 1 to job 2 then another from job 2 to job 4.

    CREATE LINKS
    nodes.name -> target
    nodes.name.needs.each -> source (source is the name of the group, not the parallel job)
    10 -> value (constant)
