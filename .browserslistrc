#
# This list of browsers is a conservative definition, based on
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#supported-web-browsers
# with the following reasoning:
#
# - We should support the latest ESR of Firefox: 91, because it used quite a lot.
# - We use Edge/Chrome >= 92 because they are about as old as the Firefox ESR
# - Safari 14.1 because it is the current minor version of the previous major version
